<p>SIR,</p>

<p class="noindent">I am very certain that a man may travel
twice through Spain, and half through
France, before he sees a woman of so much
beauty, elegance, and breeding, as the mistress
of the house I lodge in near this city.
I was directed to the house, and recommended
to the lady, as a lodger; but both
were so fine, and superior in all respects to
any thing I had seen out of Paris, that I
began to suspect I had been imposed upon.
The lady who received me appeared to be
(it was candle-light) about eighteen, a
tall, elegant figure, a beautiful face, and an
address inferior to none: I concluded she
was the daughter, till she informed me,
that <i>Mons. Saigny</i>, her husband, was gone
to <i>Avignon</i>. What added, perhaps, to this
lady's beauty in my eyes, or rather ears,
was her misfortune,&mdash;she could not speak
louder than a gentle whisper. After seeing
her sumptuous apartments, I told her I
would not ask what her price was, but tell
her what I could afford only to give; and
observed, that as it was winter, and the
snow upon the ground, perhaps she had
better take my price than have none. She
instantly took me by the hand and said,
she had so much respect for the English
nation, that my price was her's; and with
a still softer whisper, and close to my ear,
said, I might come in as soon as I pleased&mdash;"<i>Quand
vous voudrez, Monsieur</i>,"
said she. We accordingly took possession
of the finest apartments, and the best beds
I ever lay on. The next day, I saw a genteel
stripling about the house, in a white
suit of cloaths, dressed <i>en militaire</i>, and began
to suspect the virtue of my fair hostess,
not perceiving for some hours that it was
my hostess herself; in the afternoon she
made us a visit in this horrid dress,&mdash;(for
horrid she appeared in my eyes)&mdash;her
cloaths were white, with red cuffs and
scarlet <i>lappels</i>; and she held in her straddling
lap a large black muff, as big as a
porridge-pot. By this visit she lost all
that respect her superlative beauty had so
justly entitled her to, and I determined
she should visit me no more in man's apparel.
When I went into the town I mentioned
this circumstance, and there I learnt,
that the real wife of <i>Mons. Saigny</i> had
parted from him, and that the lady, my
hostess, was his mistress. The next day,
however, the master arrived; and after being
full and finely dressed, he made me a
visit, and proffers of every attention in his
power: he told me he had injured his fortune,
and that he was not rich; but that he
had served in the army, and was a gentleman:
he had been bred a protestant, but
had just embraced the true faith, in order
to qualify himself for an employment about
the court of the Pope's <i>Legate</i> at <i>Avignon</i>.
After many expressions of regard, he asked
me to dine with him the next day;
but I observed that as he was not rich,
and as I paid but a small rent in proportion
to his noble apartments, I begged to
be excused; but he pressed it so much,
that I was obliged to give him some <i>other
reasons</i>, which did not prove very pleasing
ones, to the lady below. This fine lady,
however, continued to sell us wood, wine,
vinegar, sallad, milk, and, in short, every
thing we wanted, at a very unreasonable
price. At length, my servant, who by agreement
made my soup in their kitchen,
said something rude to my landlord, who
complained to me, and seemed satisfied
with the reprimand I had given the man;
but upon a repetition of his rudeness,
<i>Mons. Saigny</i> so far forgot himself as to
speak equally rude to me: this occasioned
some warm words, and so much ungovernable
passion in him, that I was obliged
to tell him I must fetch down my
pistols; this he construed into a direct
challenge, and therefore retired to his apartments,
wrote a card, and sent it to me
while I was walking before the door with
a priest, his friend and visitor, and in sight
of the <i>little female captain his second</i>, and
all the servants of the house; on this card
was wrote, "<i>Sir, I accept your proposition</i>;"
and before I could even read it, he
followed his man, who brought it in the
true stile of a butler, rather than a butcher,
with a white napkin under his arm. You
may be sure, I was no more disposed to
fight than <i>Mons. Saigny</i>; indeed, I told
him I would not; but if any man attacked
me on my way to or from the town, where
I went every day, I would certainly defend
myself: and fortunately I never met
<i>Mons. Saigny</i> in the fortnight I staid after
in his house; for I could not bear to
leave a town where I had two or three very
agreeable acquaintance, and one (<i>Mons.
Seguier</i>) whose house was filled as full of
natural and artificial curiosities, as his head
is with learning and knowledge. Here too
I had an opportunity of often visiting the
Amphitheatre, <i>the Maison Carree</i>, (so Mons.
Seguier writes it) and the many remains
of Roman monuments so common in and
about <i>Nismes</i>. I measured some of the
stones under which I passed to make the
<i>tout au tour</i> of the Amphitheatre, they were
seventeen feet in length, and two in thickness;
and most of the stones on which the
spectators sat within the area, were twelve
feet long, two feet ten inches wide, and
one foot five inches deep; except only
those of the sixth row of seats from the
top, and they alone are one foot ten inches
deep; probably it was on that range the
people of the highest rank took their seats,
not only for the elevation, but the best situation
for sight and security; yet one of
these great stones cannot be considered
more, in comparison to the whole building,
than a single brick would be in the
construction of Hampton-Court Palace.
When I had the sole possession (and I had
it often) of this vast range of seats, where
emperors, empresses, Roman knights, and
matrons, have been so often seated, to see
men die wantonly by the hands of other
men, as well as beasts for their amusement,
I could not but with pleasure reflect,
how much human nature is softened since
that time; for notwithstanding the powerful
prevalency of custom and fashion, I
do not think the ladies of the present age
would <i>plume</i> their towering heads, and curl
their <i>borrowed</i> hair, with that glee, to see
men murdered by missive weapons, as to
die at their feet by deeper, tho' less visible
wounds. If, however, we have not those
cruel sports, we seem to be up with them
in prodigality, and to exceed them in luxury
and licentiousness; for in Rome, not
long before the final dissolution of the state,
the candidates for public employments, in
spite of the penal laws to restrain it, <i>bribed
openly</i>, and were chosen sometimes <i>by arms</i>
as well as money. In the senate, things
were conducted no better; decrees of great
consequence were made when very few
senators were present; the laws were violated
by private knaves, under the colour
of public necessity; till at length, <i>C&aelig;sar</i>
seized the sovereign power, and tho' he
was slain, they omitted to recover their
liberty, forgetting that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"A day, an hour, of virtuous Liberty</div>
<div class="i0">Is worth a whole eternity of bondage."</div>
<div class="i8"><i>Addison's</i> <span class="smcap">Cato</span>.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I can almost think I read in the parallel,
which I fear will soon be drawn between
the rise and fall of the British and Roman
empire, something like this;&mdash;"Rome
had her <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>; Britain her <span class="smcap">Camden</span>:
Cicero, who had preserved Rome
from the conspiracy of <i>Catiline</i>, was
banished: <span class="smcap">Camden</span>, who would have
preserved Britain from a bloody civil
war, removed." The historian will
add, probably, that "those who brought
desolation upon their land, did not mean
that there should be no commonwealth,
but that right or wrong, they should
continue to controul it: they did not
mean to burn the capitol to ashes, but
to bear absolute sway in the capitol:&mdash;The
result was, however, that though
they did not mean to overthrow the
state, yet they risqued all, rather than
be overthrown themselves; and they rather
promoted the massacre of their fellow-citizens,
than a reconciliation and
union of parties,"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thus fell Rome</span>&mdash;Take
heed, <span class="smcap">Britain</span>!</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXXV" id="LETTER_XXXV"></a>LETTER XXXV.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Arles</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent">I left <i>Nismes</i> reluctantly, having formed
there an agreeable and friendly intimacy
with Mr. <i>D'Oliere</i>, a young gentleman of
Switzerland; and an edifying, and entertaining
acquaintance, with Mons. <i>Seguier</i>.
I left too, the best and most sumptuous
lodgings I had seen in my whole tour; but
a desire to see <i>Arles</i>, <i>Aix</i>, and <i>Marseilles</i>,
&amp;c. got the better of all. But I set out
too soon after the snow and rains, and I
found part of the road so bad, that I wonder
how my horse dragged us through so
much clay and dirt. When I gave you
some account of the antiquities of <i>Nismes</i>,
I did not expect to find <i>Arles</i> a town fraught
with ten times more matter and amusement
for an antiquarian; but I found it
not only a fine town now, but that it abounds
with an infinite number of monuments
which evince its having once been
an almost second Rome. There still remains
enough of the Amphitheatre to
convince the beholder what a noble edifice
it was, and to wonder why so little,
of so large and solid a building, remains.
The town is built on the banks of the
Rhone, over which, on a bridge of barges,
we entered it; but it is evident, that in
former days, the sea came quite up to it,
and that it was a haven for ships of burden;
but the sea has retired some leagues
from it, many ages since; beside an hundred
strong marks at <i>this</i> day of its having
been a sea-port formerly, the following
inscription found a century or two ago, in
the church of <i>St. Gabriel</i>, will clearly
confirm it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">M. FRONTONI EVPOR</div>
<div class="i3">I<span class="smcap">iiii</span>IVIR AVG. COL. JVLIA.</div>

<div class="i3">CORP. ERNAGINENSIUM.</div>
<div class="i5">JULIA NICE VXOR.</div>
<div class="i4">CONJVGI KARISSIMO.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed there are many substantial reasons
to believe, that it was at this town <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> built the twelve gallies, which,
from the cutting of the wood to the time
they were employed on service, was but
thirty days.&mdash;That it was a very considerable
city in the time of the first Emperors,
is past all doubt. <i>Constantine</i> the Great
held his court, and resided at <i>Arles</i>, with
all his family; and the Empress <i>Faustina</i>
was delivered of a son here (<i>Constantine</i>
the younger) and it was long before so celebrated
for an annual fair held in the
month of August, that it was called <i>le
Noble Marche de Gaules</i>. And <i>Strabo</i>, in
his dedication of his book to the Emperor,
called it "<i>Galliarum Emporium
non Parvum</i>;" which is a proof that it was
celebrated for its rich commerce, &amp;c. five
hundred years before it became under the
dominion of the Romans. But were I
capable of giving you a particular description
of all the monuments of antiquity
in and near this town, it would compose a
little book, instead of a sheet or two of
paper. I shall therefore only pick out a
few things which have afforded me the
most entertainment, and I hope may give
you a little; but I shall begin with mentioning
what must first give you concern, in
saying that in that part of the town called
<i>la Roquette</i>, I was shewn the place where
formerly stood an elevated Altar whereon,
three young citizens were sacrificed annually,
and who were fattened at the public
expence during a whole year, for the horrid
purpose! On the first of May their throats
were cut in the presence of a prodigious
multitude of people assembled from all
parts; among whom the blood of the victims
was thrown, as they imagined all their
sins were expiated by that barbarous sacrifice;
which horrid practice was put a stop
to by the first Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, <span class="smcap">St. Trophime</span>.
The Jews, who had formerly
a synagogue in <i>Arles</i>, were driven out in
the year 1493, when that and their celebrated
School were demolished. There
were found about an hundred after, among
the stones of those buildings some Hebrew
characters neatly cut, which were copied
and sent to the Rabbins of Avignon, to be
translated, and who explained them then
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Chodesh: Elvl. Chamescheth, lamech, nav. Nislamv.
Bedikoth. Schradai.</p></div>

<p>i.e. they say,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the month of August five thousand and thirty&mdash;the
Visitation of God ceased."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the plague had visited them.&mdash;There
was also another Hebrew inscription,
which was on the tomb of a famous
Rabbin called Solomon, surnamed the
grandson of David.</p>

<p>The Amphitheatre of <i>Arles</i> was of an
oval form, composed of three stages; each
stage containing sixty arches; the whole
was built of hewn stone of an immense size,
without mortar, and of a prodigious thickness:
the circumference above, exclusive
of the projection of the architecture, was
194 toises three feet, the frontispiece 17
toises high and the area 71 toises long and
52 wide; the walls were 17 toises thick,
which were pierced round and round with
a gallery, for a convenience of passing in
and out of the seats, which would conveniently
contain 30,000 men, allowing
each person three feet in depth and two in
width; and yet, there remain at this day
only a few arches quite complete from
top to bottom, which are of themselves a
noble monument. Indeed one would be
inclined to think that it never had been
compleated, did we not know that the Romans
left nothing unfinished of that kind;
and read, that the Emperor <i>Gallus</i>gave
some superb spectacles in the Amphiteatre
of <i>Arles</i>, and that the same amusements
were continued by following Emperors.
Nothing can be a stronger proof than these
ruins, of the certain destruction and corruption
of all earthly things; for one would
think that the small parts which now remain
of this once mighty building would,
endure as long as the earth itself; but what
is very singular is, that this very Amphitheatre
was built upon the ruins of a more
mighty building, and perhaps one of a more
substantial structure. <i>Tempus edax rerum,
tuque invidiosa vetustas omnia destruis</i>. In
the street called <i>St. Claude</i>, stood a triumphal
arch which was called <i>L'Arche admirable</i>;
it is therefore natural to conclude,
that the town contained many others of
less beauty. There are also within the walls
large remains of the palace of <i>Constantine</i>.
A beautiful antique statue of <i>Venus</i>
was found here also, about an hundred and
twenty years ago.&mdash;That a <i>veritable</i> fine woman
should set all the beaux and <i>connoisseurs</i>
of a whole town in a flame, I do not much
wonder; but you will be surprized when I
tell you that this cold trunk of marble, (for
the arms were never found) put the whole
town of <i>Arles</i> together by the ears; one
<i>S&ccedil;avant</i> said it was the goddess <i>Diana</i>,
and wrote a book to prove it; another insisted
upon it, that it was the true image of
<i>Venus</i>; then starts up an Ecclesiastic, who
<i>you know has nothing to do with women</i>, and
he pronounced in dogmatical terms, it was
neither one nor the other; at length the
wiser magistrates of the town agreed to
send it as a present to their august monarch
Lewis the XIVth; and if you have
a mind to see an inanimate woman who
has made such a noise in the world, you
will find her at <i>Versailles</i>, without any
other notice taken of her or the quarrels
about her, than the following words written
(I think) upon her pedestal, <i>La Venus
d'Arles</i>. This ended the dispute, as I
must my letter.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_XXXVI" id="LETTER_XXXVI"></a>LETTER XXXVI.</h2>


<p>I have not half done with <i>Arles</i>. The
more I saw and heard in this town, the
more I found was to be seen. The remains
of the Roman theatre here would of
itself be a sufficient proof that it was a
town of great riches and importance.
Among the refuse of this building they
found several large vases of baked earth,
which were open on one side, and which
were fixed properly near the seats of the
audience to receive and convey the sounds
of the instruments and voices of the actors
distinctly throughout the theatre, which
had forty-eight arches, eleven behind the
scenes of ten feet wide, three grand arches
of fourteen feet wide, and thirty-one of
twelve feet; the diameter was thirty-one
canes, and the circumference seventy-nine;
and from the infinite number of
beautiful pieces of sculpture, frizes, architraves,
pillars of granite, &amp;c. which have
been dug up, it is very evident that this
theatre was a most magnificent building,
and perhaps would have stood firm to this
day, had not a Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, from a
principle of more piety than wisdom, stript
it of the finest ornaments and marble pillars,
to adorn the churches. Near the
theatre stood also the famous temple of
<i>Diana</i>; and, as the famous statue mentioned
in my former letter was found beneath
some noble marble pillars near that
spot, it is most likely <i>La Venus d'Arles</i> is
nevertheless the Goddess <i>Diana</i>.</p>

<p>I never wish more for your company
than when I walk, (and I walk every day)
in the Elysian fields. The spot is beautiful,
the prospect far and near equally so:
in the middle of this ancient <i>Cimetiere</i>
stands a motly building, from the middle
of which however rises a cupola, which at
the first view informs you it is the work of
a Roman artist; and here you must, as it
were, thread the needle between an infinite
number of Pagan and Christian monuments,
lying thick upon the surface in the
utmost disorder and confusion, insomuch,
that one would think the Day of Judgment
was arrived and the dead were risen.
Neither <i>Stepney</i> church-yard, nor any one
in or near a great city, shew so many headstones
as this spot does stone coffins of an
immense size, hewn out of one piece; the
covers of most of which have been broken
or removed sufficiently to search for such
things as were usually buried with the
dead. Some of these monuments, and
some of the handsomest too, are still however
unviolated. It is very easy to distinguish
the Pagan from the Christian <ins class="correction" title="This should read 'monuments'.">monnments</ins>,
without opening them, as all the
former have the Roman letters DM (<i>Diis
Manibus</i>) cut upon them. It is situated,
according to their custom, near the high-way,
the water, and the marshes. You
know the ancients preferred such spots for
the interment of the dead.</p>

<p>The tombs of <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Hector</i>, <span class="smcap">Homer</span>
says, were near the sea, as well as
other heroes of antiquity; for as they considered
man to be composed of earth and
water, his bones ought to be laid in one,
and near the other.</p>

<p>I will now give you a few of the most
curious inscriptions; but first I will mention
a noble marble monument, moved
from this spot into the <i>Cimetiere</i> of the
great Hospital. This tomb is ornamented
with Cornucopi&aelig;, <i>Pater&aelig;</i>, &amp;c. and in a
shield the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">CABILIAE D.F. APPRVLLAE FLAM</div>
<div class="i0">D   DESIGNATAE COL. DEA. AUG. VOC.   M</div>
<div class="i2">O. ANNOS XIIII, MENS II. DIES V.</div>
<div class="i2">MARITVS VXORI PIENTISSIMAE.</div>
<div class="i8"><span class="smcap">posuit</span>.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This poor girl was not only too young
to die, but too young to marry, one would
think; I wish therefore her afflicted husband
had told us how many years he had
been married to a wife who died at the
age of fourteen, two months, and five
days. The cornucopi&aelig;, I suppose, were
to signify that this virtuous wife, I was
going to say maid, was the source of all
his pleasure and happiness. The <i>Pater&aelig;</i>
were vases destined to receive the blood of
the victims.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Supponunt alij cultros, tepidumque cruorem</div>
<div class="i0">Suscipiunt Pateris,&mdash;<i>Says the Poet</i>.</div>
</div></div>

<p>On each side of the tomb are the symbols
of sacrifice. It is very evident from
the fine polish of this monument, that her
husband had obtained the Emperor's particular
leave to finish it highly.</p>

<p>Rogum <i>ascia ne Polito</i> says the law of
the twelve tables.</p>

<p>On another tomb, which is of common
stone, in the middle of a shield supported
by two Cupids, is the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">M IVNIO MESSIANO</div>
<div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;VTRICI. CORP. ARELAT.</div>
<div class="i0">D   EIVS D. CORP. MAG. III. F   M</div>

<div class="i1">M. V. D. X. IVNIA VALERIA.</div>
<div class="i2">ALVMNO CLARISSIMO.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The first word of the second line is much
obliterated.</p>


<p>There are an infinite number of other
monuments with inscriptions; but those
above, and this below, will be sufficient
for me to convey to you, and you to my
friend at <i>Winchester</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Before I leave <i>Arles</i>, and I leave it reluctantly,
whatever you may do, I must
not omit to mention the principal monument,
and pride of it, at this day, i.e.
their Obelisque. I will not tell you where
nor when it was dug up; it is sufficient to
say, it was found here, that it is a single
piece of granite, sixty-one feet high, and
seven feet square below; yet it was elevated
in the Market-place, upon a modern
pedestal, which bears four fulsome complimentary
inscriptions to <i>Lewis</i> the XIV.
neither of which will I copy. In elevating
this monstrous single stone, the inhabitants
were very adroit: they set it upright
in a quarter of an hour, in the year
1676, just an hundred years ago, amidst
an infinite number of joyful spectators,
who are now all laid in their lowly graves;
for though it weighed more than two
thousand hundred weight, yet by the help
of capsterns, it was raised without any
difficulty. The great King <i>Harry</i> the
IVth had ordered the houses in the arena
of the Amphitheatre to be thrown down,
and this obelisk to be fixed in the center
of it; but his death, and <i>Lewis</i>'s vanity,
fixed it where it now stands; it has no
beauty however to boast of but its age and
size, for it bears neither polish, characters,
nor hieroglyphicks, but, as it seems to
have been an Egyptian monument, the
inhabitants of <i>Arles</i> have, like those people,
consecrated it below to their King,
and above to the sun: on the top is fixed
a globe of azure, sprinkled with <i>fleurs
de lis d'or</i>, and crowned with a radiant
sun, that is to say, as the sun was made
by GOD to enlighten the world, so <span class="smcap">Lewis
le Grand</span> was made to govern it.</p>


<p>I am sure now, you will excuse my
mentioning what is said of this great man
<i>below</i>; but speaking of light, I must not
omit to mention, that there are men of
veracity now living in this town, who affirm,
that they have seen, upon opening
some of the ancient monuments here, the
eternal lamps burning. The number of
testimonies we have of this kind puts the
matter past a doubt, that a flame has appeared
at the lip of these lamps when first
the tombs have been opened; one was
found, you know, on the <i>Appian</i> way, in
the tomb of <i>Cicero</i>'s daughter, which had
burnt more than seventeen centuries; another
at <i>Padua</i>, which had burnt eight hundred
years, and which was found hanging
between two little phials, one of gold, the
other of silver, which were both quite
full of liquor, extremely clear, as well as
many others; but as it is impossible to believe
that flame can exist, and not consume
that which feeds it, is it not more natural
to conclude that those lamps, phials, &amp;c.
contained a species of phosphorus, which
became luminous upon the first opening of
the tombs and the sudden rushing in of
fresh air; and that the reverse of what
is generally supposed is the fact, that they
are not extinguished, but illuminated by
the fresh air they receive? I have seen several
of these lamps here and elsewhere,
most of which are of baked earth. It has
been said, that there is an oil to be extracted
from gold, which will not consume,
and that a wick of <i>asbestos</i> has burnt
many years in this oil, without consumption
to either. I have seen a book written
by a German Jesuit, to confirm this
fact; so there is authority for you, if not
conviction.</p>


<p>As I know your keen appetite after
antiquities, I will send you a few other
inscriptions, and leave you to make your
own comments; and <i>voila</i>.</p>

<p>In the ancient church of <i>St. Honore</i>,
which stands in the center of all these
Heathen and Christian monuments, are to
be seen nine Bacchanalians of very ancient
workmanship; where also is the tomb of
<i>St. Honore</i>, employed as the altar of the
church; and beneath the church are catacombs,
where the first Christians retired
to prayer during the persecution by the
Emperors, and where is still to be seen
their altar and seven ancient sepulchres, of
beautiful marble, and exquisitely worked;
the first is the tomb of <i>St. Genet</i>; the second
of <i>St. Roland</i>, Archbishop of <i>Arles</i>;
the third of <i>St. Concord</i>, with an epitaph,
and two doves with olive branches in their
beaks, cut in bass relief, and underneath
are the two letters X and P; on this tomb
is the miraculous cross seen in the heavens
by <i>Constantine</i>, who is represented before
it on his knees; and on the cover of this
tomb are the heads of <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Faustina</i>,
and his son; and they say the Emperor
saw this miracle in the heaven from the
very <i>Cimetiere</i> in which this monument
stands, i.e. in the year 315; the fifth is
the tomb of <i>St. Dorothy</i>, Virgin and Martyr
of <i>Arles</i>; the sixth <i>St. Virgil</i>, and the
seventh <i>St. Hiliare</i>, (both Archbishops of
<i>Arles</i>,) who has borrowed a Pagan sepulchre,
for it is adorned with the principal
divinities of the ancients in bass relief.&mdash;It
seems odd to see on a Christian Bishop's
tomb <i>Venus</i>, and the three Destinies. The
people here say, that this tomb represents
human life, as the ancients believed that
each God contributed something towards
the being. Be that as it may, the tomb
is a very curious one, and much admired
by the <i>Connoisseurs</i>, for its excellent workmanship;
but what is more extraordinary
than all these, is, that this catacomb, standing
in the middle of the others, with its
cover well and closely fixed, has always
water in it, and often is quite full,
and nobody can tell (<i>but one of the priests
perhaps</i>) from what source it comes. There
is also in this church the tomb and a long
Latin Epitaph of <i>St. Trophime</i>, their first
Bishop; but the characters are very Gothic,
and the Cs are square, [Image: E E with no mid bar]; he
came here in the year 61, and preached
down that abominable practice of sacrificing
three young men annually. He
died in the year 61, at 72 years of age.
On the front of the Metropolitan church
of <i>Arles</i>, called <i>St. Trophime</i>, are the two
following lines, in Gothic characters, cut
above a thousand years:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Cernitur eximius vir Christi Discipulorum,</div>
<div class="i0">De Numero Trophimus, hic Septuaginta duorum.</div>
</div></div>


<p>This church was built in the year 625,
by <i>St. Virgil</i>, and is a curious piece of antiquity
within, and particularly without;
but I will not omit to give you one of its
singularities within; it is an ancient and
curious inscription in large Gothic letters,
near the organ:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="center">
<table summary="Gothic inscription in church, St Trophime.">
<tr><td>Terrarum Roma</td>         <td>Gemina de luce majistrA.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Olim Contrito</td>         <td>Letheo Contulit OrchO.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>To read this you will see you must take the
first letter of each verse: TRO, <i>Trophemus</i>;
GAL, <i>Galli&aelig;orum</i>; and APO, <i>Apostolus</i>.
The letter H, belonging to the
word <i>Joseph</i>, must be carried to the word
<i>Orcho</i>, and the P must stand by itself.</p>

<p><i>Trophimus Galliarum Apostolus, ut ros

<p class="noindent">Soon after we left the town of <i>Arles</i>,
on our way to <i>Aix</i>, and this city, we
entered upon a most extraordinary and extensive
plain; it is called the <i>Crau</i>, and is
a principal and singular domain, belonging
to and situated on the south side of that
city; it is ten leagues in diameter; on
which vast extent, scarce a tree, shrub, or
verdure is visible; the whole spot being
covered with flint stones of various sizes,
and of singular shapes. <i>Petrarch</i> says, as
<i>Strabo</i>, and others have said before him,
that those flint stones fell from Heaven
like hail, when <i>Hercules</i> was fighting there
against the giants, who, finding he was
likely to be overcome, invoked his father
<i>Jupiter</i>, who rained this hard shower of
flint stones upon his enemies, which is
confirmed by <i>&AElig;schylus</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Jupiter Alcidem quando respexit inormem,</div>
<div class="i0">Illachrymans, Ligures saxoso perpluit imbre."</div>
</div></div>

<p>But as this account may not be quite
satisfactory to you, who I know love truth
more than fable, I am inclined to think
you will consider <i>Possidonius</i>'s manner of
accounting for it more feasible: He says,
that it was once a great lake, and having a
bed of gravel at the bottom, those pebble
stones, by a succession of ages, have grown
to the size they now appear; but whether
stones grow which lie upon the surface of
the earth and out of their proper strata,
I must leave you and other naturalists to
determine, without repeating to you what
<i>Aristotle</i>, and others, have said upon that
subject; and therefore, instead of telling
you either what they say, or I think, I will
tell you what I know, which is, that barren
as the <i>Crau</i> appears to be, it not only
feeds, but fattens an infinite number of
sheep and cattle, and produces such excellent
wine too in some parts of it, that it is
called <i>Vin de Crau</i>, by way of pre-eminence:
it has a poignant quality, is very
bright, and is much esteemed for its delicious
flavour. The herb which fattens
the sheep and feeds such quantities of cattle
is a little plant which grows between
and under the flint stones, which the sheep
and other animals turn up with their feet,
to come at the bite; beside which, there
grows a plant on this <i>Crau</i> that bears a
vermilion flower, from which the finest
scarlet dye is extracted; it is a little red
grain, about the size of pea, and is gathered
in the month of May; it has been
sold for a crown a pound formerly; and
a single crop has produced eleven thousand
weight. This berry is the harvest of
the poor, who are permitted to gather it
on a certain day, but not till the Lord of
the Manor gives notice by the sound of a
horn, according to an ancient custom and
privilege granted originally by King <span class="smcap">Rene</span>.&mdash;On
my way over it, I <i>gathered</i> only a
great number of large larks by the help
of my gun, though I did not forget my
<i>Montserrat</i> vow: It was a fine day, and
therefore I did not find it so tedious as it
must be in winter or bad weather; for if
any thing can be worse than sea, in bad
weather, it must be this vast plain, which
is neither land or sea, though not very
distant from the latter, and in all probability
was many ages since covered by the
ocean.</p>

<p>The first town we came to after passing
this vast plain, I have forgot the name of;
but it had nothing but its antiquity and a
noble and immense old castle to recommend
it, except a transparent agate statue
of the Virgin in the church, as large as
the life, with a <i>tin crown</i> upon her head.
Neither the town nor the inhabitants had
any thing of the appearance of French
about them; every thing and every body
looked so wild, and the place was in such a
ruinous condition, that I could scarce believe
I was not among the Arabs in <i>Egypt</i>,
or the ruins of <i>Persepolis</i>. Without the
town, in a fine beautiful lawn stands a
most irregular high and rude rock, perpendicular
on all sides, and under one side
of it are ruins of a house, which I suppose
was inhabited by the first <i>Seigneur</i> in the
province. I looked in, and found the
ruins full of miserable inhabitants, I fancy
many families; but it exhibited such a
scene of woe, that I was glad to get out
again; and upon inquiry, I found it had
been in that state ever since it had been
used as an hospital during the last
plague.</p>

<p class="noindent">As the good and evil, which fall within
the line of a road, as well as a worldly
traveller, are by comparison, I need not
say what a heavenly country <i>France</i> (with
all its untoward circumstances) appeared
to us <i>after</i> having journeyed in <i>Spain</i>:
what would have put me out of temper
before, became now a consolation. <i>How
glad I should I have been, and how perfectly
content, had it been thus in Spain</i>, was always
uppermost, when things ran a little
cross in France.</p>

<p>Travellers and strangers in France, in
a long journey perhaps, have no connection
with any people, but such who have
a design upon their purse. At every <i>Auberge</i>
some officious coxcomb lies in wait
to ensnare them, and under one pretence
or other, introduces himself; he will offer
to shew you the town; if you accept
it, you are saddled with an impertinent
visiter the whole time you stay; if you
refuse it, he is affronted; so let him; for
no gentleman ever does that without an
easy or natural introduction; and then,
if they are men of a certain age, their acquaintance
is agreeable and useful. An
under-bred Frenchman is the most offensive
civil thing in the world: a well-bred
Frenchman, quite the reverse.&mdash;Having
dined at the table of a person of fashion
at <i>Aix</i>, a pert priest, one the company,
asked me many questions relative
to the customs and manners of the English
nation; and among other things, I
explained to him the elegance in which
the tables of people of the first fashion
were served; and told him, that when
any one changed his dish, that his plate,
knife and fork, were changed also, and
that they were as perfectly bright and
clean as the day they came from the silver-smith's
shop. After a little pause,
and a significant sneer,&mdash;Pray Sir, (said
he) and do you not change your napkins
also? I was piqued a little, and told him
we did not, but that indeed I had made
a little mistake, which I would rectify,
which was, that though I had told him
the plate, knife, and fork, were so frequently
changed at genteel tables in England,
there was one exception to it; for
it sometimes happened that low under-bred
priests (especially on a Sunday) were
necessarily admitted to the tables of people
of fashion, and that the butler sometimes
left them to wipe their knife upon
their bread, as I had often seen <i>Lewis</i> the
Fifteenth do, even after eating fish with it.&mdash;As
it was on a Sunday I had met with
this fop of divinity, at a genteel table, I
thought I had been even with him, and I
believe he thought so too, for he asked
me no more questions; yet he assured me
at his going out, "<i>he had the honour to be
my most obedient humble servant</i>." This
over-strained civility, so unlike good-breeding,
puts me in mind of what was
said of poor Sir <span class="smcap">Wm. St. Q&mdash;&mdash;n</span>, after
his death, by an arch wag at <i>Bath</i>: Sir
William, you know, was a polite old gentleman,
but had the manners and breeding
rather of the late, than the present age,
and though a man deservedly esteemed
for his many virtues, was by some thought
too ceremonious. Somebody at the round
table at <i>Morgan</i>'s Coffee-house happened
to say, alas! poor Sir William! he is gone;
but he was a good man, and is surely gone
to Heaven, and I can tell you what he
said when he first entered the holy gates!
the interrogation followed of course:
Why, said he, seeing a large concourse of
departed souls, and not a soul that he
knew, he bowed to the right and left,
said he begged pardon,&mdash;he feared he was
troublesome, and if so, he would instantly
retire.&mdash;So the Frenchman, when he says
he would cut himself in four pieces to
serve you, only means to be very civil, and
he will be so, if it does not put him to any
expence.</p>

<p><i>Aix</i> is a well built city; the principal
street called the <i>Course</i>, is very long, very
broad, and shaded by stately trees; in the
middle of it are four or five fountains,
constantly running, one of which is of very
hot water, at which man and beast are
constantly drinking. The city abounds
with a great deal of good company, drawn
to it from all parts of Europe by the efficacy
of the waters, and to examine its
antiquities, for it has in and about it many
Greek as well as Roman monuments.</p>

<p>Some part of the country between <i>Aix</i>
and this populous city is very beautiful,
but near the town scarce any vegetation
is seen; on all sides high hills and broken
rocks present themselves; and one wonders
how a city so large and so astonishingly
populous is supported. When I
first approached the entrance gate, it opened
a perspective view of the <i>Course</i>, a street
of great extent, where the heads of the
people were so thick together, that I concluded
it was a <span class="smcap">fair</span> day, and that the
whole country was collected together;
but I found it was every day the same.
I saw a prodigious quantity of game and
provisions of all kinds, not only in the
shops, but in the streets, and concluded
it was not only a cheap, but a plentiful
country; but I soon found my mistake,
it was the evening before Lent commenced,
and I could find no provisions of
any kind very easily afterwards, and every
thing very dear. You may imagine the
price of provisions at <i>Marseilles</i> when I
tell you that they have their poultry from
<i>Lyons</i>; it is however a noble city, crouded
with men of all nations, walking in the
streets in the proper habits of their country.
The harbour is the most secure sea-port
in Europe, being land-locked on all
sides, except at a verry narrow entrance;
and as there is very little rise or fall of
water, the vessels are always afloat. Many
of the galley slaves have little shops near
the spot where the galleys are moored,
and appear happy and decently dressed;
some of them are rich, and make annual
remittances to their friends. In the <i>Hotel
de Ville</i> are two fine large pictures,
which were taken lately from the Jesuits'
college; one represents the dreadful scenes
which were seen in the <i>Grand Course</i> during
the great plague at <i>Marseilles</i>; the other,
the same sad scene on the Quay, before the
doors of the house in which it now hangs.
A person cannot look upon these pictures
one minute before he becomes enthralled
in the woes which every way present
themselves. You see the good Bishop
confessing the sick, the carts carrying out
the dead, children sucking at the breasts
of their dead mothers, wives and husbands
bewailing, dead bodies lowering out of the
higher windows by cords, the slaves plundering,
the Priests exhorting, and such a
variety of interesting and afflicting scenes
so forcibly struck out by the painter, that
you seem to hear the groans, weepings,
and bewailings, from the dying, the sick
and the sound; and the eye and mind
have no other repose on these pictures but
by fixing it on a dead body. The painter,
who was upon the spot, has introduced his
own figure, but armed like a serjeant with
a halberd. The pictures are indeed dreadfully
fine; one is much larger than the other;
and it is said the town Magistrates
cut it to fit the place it is in; but it is impossible
to believe any body of men could
be guilty of such an act of <i>barbarism</i>!
There is still standing in this town, the
house of a Roman senator, now inhabited
by a shoe-maker. In the cathedral they
have a marble-stone, on which there is engraved,
in Arabic characters, a monumental
inscription to the following effect:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">"<span class="smcap">God</span> is alone permanent.</div>
<div class="i0">This is the Sepulchre of his servant and Martyr,</div>
<div class="i0">who having placed his confidence in the Most</div>
<div class="i0">High, he trusts that his sins will be forgiven."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, son of <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>, of the town of <i>Metelin</i>,</div>
<div class="i7">died in the moon <i>Zilhage</i>.</div>
</div></div>


<p>I bought here an Egyptian household
<i>God</i>, or <i>Lar</i> of solid metal, which was
lately dug up near the city walls; it is about
nine inches high, and weighs about
five pounds. Several of the hieroglyphic
characters are visible on the breast and
back, and its form is that of an embalmed
mummy. By a wholesome law of this city,
the richest citizen must be buried like the
poorest, in a coffin of nine livres value,
and that coffin must be bought at the
general Hospital. The sale of these coffins
for the dead, goes a great way towards
the support of the poor and the sick.</p>

<p>At this town I experienced the very reverse
in every respect of what I met with
at <i>Barcelona</i>, though I had no better recommendation
to Mr. <span class="smcap">Birbeck</span>, his Britannick
Majesty's Agent here, than I had
to the Consul of <i>Barcelona</i>; he took my
word, at first sight, nay, he took my notes
and gave me money for them, and shewed
me and my family many marks of friendly
attention: Such a man, at such a distance
from ones own country, is a cordial to a
troubled breast, and an acquisition to every
Englishman who goes there either for
health or curiosity. Mr. <i>Birbeck</i> took me
with him to a noble Concert, to which he
is an annual subscriber, and which was
performed in a room in every respect suitable
to so large a band, and so brilliant an
assembly: He and his good wife were the
only two British faces I had seen for many
months, who looked like Britons. I shall,
indeed I must, soon leave this town, and
shall take <i>Avignon</i> on my way to <i>Lyons</i>,
from whence you shall soon hear from me
again.</p>

<p>I had forgot to mention, when I was
speaking of <i>Montpellier</i>, that the first gentry
are strongly impressed with the notion
of the superiority of the English, in
every part of philosophy, more especially
in the science of physic; and I found at
<i>Montpellier</i>, that these sentiments so favourable
to our countrymen, had been
much increased by the extraordinary knowledge
and abilities of Dr. <span class="smcap">Milman</span>, an
English physician, who resided there during
the winter 1775. This gentleman,
who is one of Doctor <span class="smcap">Radcliffe's</span> travelling
physicians, had performed several
very astonishing cures, in cases which the
French Physicians had long treated without
success: And indeed the French physicians,
however checked by interest or
envy, were obliged to acknowledge this
gentleman's uncommon sagacity in the
treatment of diseases. What I say of this
ingenious traveller, is for your sake more
than his; for I know nothing more of him
than the fame he has left behind him at
<i>Montpellier</i>, and which I doubt not will
soon be verified by his deeds among his
own countrymen.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Avignon.</span></p>


<p class="noindent">There is no dependence on what
travellers say of different towns and places
they have visited, and therefore you
must not lay too much stress upon what
I say. A Lady of fashion, who had travelled
all over France, gave the preference
to the town I wrote last to you from (<i>Marseilles</i>);
to me, the climate excepted, it is
of all others the most disagreeable; yet
that Lady did not mean to deceive; but
people often prefer the town for the sake
of the company they find, or some particular
or local circumstance that attended
their residence in it; in that respect, I too
left it reluctantly, having met with much
civility and some old friends there; but
surely, exclusive of its fine harbour, and
favourable situation for trade, it has little
else to recommend it, but riot, mob, and
confusion; provisions are very dear, and
not very good.</p>

<p>On our road here we came again through
<i>Aix</i>. The <i>Mule blanche</i> without the town,
is better than any auberge within, and
Mons. <i>L'Abbe Abrard Pr&aelig;tor, de la ordre
de St. Malta</i>, is not only a very agreeable,
but a very convenient acquaintance
for a stranger, and who is always ready to
shew the English in particular, attention,
and who had much attention shewn him
by Lord A. <span class="smcap">Percy</span> and his Lady.</p>

<p>From <i>Aix</i> we passed through <i>Lambresque</i>,
<i>Orgon</i>, and <i>Sencage</i>, a fine country, full of
almond trees, and which were in full blossom
on the 7th of March. At <i>Orgon</i> the
post-house was so bad, that after my horse
was in the stable, I was obliged to put him
to, and remove to the <i>Soleil d'Or</i>, without
the town, and made a good move too.
The situation of <i>Notre Dame de St. Piere</i>,
a convent on a high hill, is worthy of notice,
and the antiquity of the town also.&mdash;Five
leagues from <i>Orgon</i> we crossed a
very aukward passage in a ferry-boat, and
were landed in the Pope's territories, about
five miles from <i>Avignon</i>. The castle, and
higher part of the town, were visible, rising
up in the middle of a vast plain, fertile
and beautiful as possible. If we were
charmed with the distant view, we were
much more so upon a nearer approach;
nothing can be more pleasing than the
well-planted, and consequently well-shaded
coach and foot roads all round this pretty
little city; all shut in with the most beautiful
ancient fortification walls I ever beheld,
and all in perfect repair; nor were
we asked any questions by the Pope's soldiers,
or Custom-house Officers. I had a
letter to Dr. <span class="smcap">Power</span>, an English Physician
in this town, who received me with great
civity, and made me known to <span class="smcap">Lord
Mountgarret</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, his
son, with whom I had the honour to spend
some very agreeable hours: his Lordship
has an excellent house here, and keeps a
table, truly characteristic of the hospitality
of his own country.&mdash;And now I cannot
help telling you of a singular disorder which
attacked me the very day I arrived; and
the still more singular manner I got well:
the day before I arrived, we had been almost
blown along the road to <i>Orgon</i> by a
most violent wind; but I did not perceive
that I had received any cold or injury from
it, till we arrived here, and then, I had
such an external soreness from head to
foot, that I almost dreaded to walk or stir,
and when I did, it was as slow as my feet
could move; after continuing so for some
days, I was much urged to dine with Lord
<span class="smcap">Mountgarret</span>, on St. Patrick's day; I
did so, and by drinking a little more than
ordinary, set nature to work, who, without
any other Doctor, did the business, by
two or three nights' copious sweats. I
would not have mentioned this circumstance,
but it may be the <i>mal du pais</i>, and
ought to be mentioned for the <i>method of
cure</i>.</p>

<p>There was not quite so good an understanding
between the Pope's <i>Legate</i> and
the English residing here, as could be wished;
some untoward circumstance had happened,
and there seemed to be faults on
both sides; it was carried, I think, to such
a length, that when the English met him,
they did not pull off their hats; but as it
happened before I came, and as in our
walks and rides we often met him airing
in his coach, we paid that respect which is
everywhere due to a first magistrate, and
he took great pains to return it most graciously;
his livery, guards, &amp;c. make a very
splendid appearance: he holds a court, and
is levee'd every Sunday, though not liked
by the French. At the church of St. <i>Didier</i>,
in a little chapel, of mean workmanship,
is the tomb of the celebrated <i>Laura</i>,
whose name <i>Petrarch</i> has rendered immortal;
the general opinion is, that she
died a virgin; but it appears by her tomb,
that she was the wife of <i>Hugues de Sade</i>,
and that she had many children. About
two hundred years after her death, some
curious people got permission to open her
tomb, in which they found a little box,
containing some verses written by <i>Petrarch</i>,
and a medallion of lead, on one side of
which was a Lady's head and on the reverse,
the four following letters, M.L.M.E.</p>

<p><i>Francis</i> the First, passing thro' <i>Avignon</i>,
visited this tomb, and left upon it the following
epitaph, of his own composition:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"En petit lien compris vous pouvez voir</div>
<div class="i0">Ce qui comprend beaucoup par renomm&egrave;e</div>
<div class="i0">Plume, labour le langue &amp; le devoir</div>
<div class="i0">Furent vaincus par l'aimant de l'aim&eacute;e</div>
<div class="i0">O gentille ame, etant tant estim&eacute;e</div>
<div class="i0">Qui le pourra louer quen se laissant?</div>
<div class="i0">Car la parole est toujours reprim&eacute;e</div>
<div class="i0">Quand le sujet surmonte le disant."</div>
</div></div>

<p>This town is crowded with convents
and churches. The convent of the <i>Celestines</i>,
founded by <i>Charles</i> the VIth, is richly
endowed, and has noble gardens: there
are not above fourteen or fifteen members,
and their revenue is near two thousand
pounds sterling a year. In their church
is a very superb monument of Pope <i>Clement</i>
the VIIth, who died here in the year
1394, as a long Latin inscription upon it
announces. They shew in this house a
picture, painted by King <i>Renee</i>; it represents
the frightful remains of his beloved
mistress, whose body he took out of the
grave, and painted it in the state he then
found it, i.e. with the worms crawling about
it: it is a hideous figure, and hideously
painted; the stone coffin stands on a
line with the figure, but is above a foot
too short for the body; and on the other
side is a long scrole of verses, written in
Gothic characters, which begin thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"<i>Une fois fus sur toutes femmes belle</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Mais par la mort suis devenue telle</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Machair estoit tres-belle fraische &amp; tendre</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>O'r est elle toute tournee en cendre.</i>"</div>
</div></div>

<p>There follow at least forty other such lines.</p>

<p>There is also in this convent, a fine monument,
on which stands the effigies of <i>St.
Benezet</i>, a shepherd of <i>Avignon</i>, who built
(they say) the bridge from the town over
the Rhone, in consequence of a dream, in
the year 1127: some of the noble arches
are still standing, and part of a very pretty
chapel on it, nearly in the middle of the
river; but a great part of the bridge has
been carried away, many years since, by
the violence of the river, which often not
only overflows its banks, but the lower
part of the town. In 1755, it rose seventeen
feet higher than its usual flowing, and
I saw marks in many of the streets, high
above my head, against the sides of houses,
which it had risen to; but with all my industry,
I could find no <i>mark upon the house
where Lady Mary Wortley Montagu dwelt</i>,
though she resided some time here, and
though I endeavoured to find it.</p>

<p>I need not describe the celebrated fountain
of <i>Vaucluse</i>, near this town, where
<i>Petrarque</i> composed his works, and established
Mount Parnassus. This is the only
part of France in which there is an Inquisition,
but the Officers seem content with
their profits and honours, without the
power.</p>

<p>One part of the town is allotted to the
Jews, where about six or seven hundred
live peaceably and have their synagogue;
and it was here the famous rabbin <i>Joseph
Meir</i> was born; he died in the year 1554;
he was author, you know, of <i>Annals des
Rois de France</i>, and <i>de la Maison Ottomane</i>.</p>

<p>Not far from <i>Avignon</i>, on the banks of
the same rapid river, stands <i>Beaucaire</i>, famous
for its annual <span class="smcap">fair</span>, where merchandize
is brought from all parts of Europe,
free of all duties: it begins on the
22d of July; and it is computed that eight
million of livres are annually expended
there in eight days. <i>Avignon</i> is remarkable
for the No. Seven, having seven ports,
seven parishes, seven colleges, seven hospitals,
and seven monasteries; and I may
add, I think, seven hundred bells, which
are always making a horrid jingle, for they
have no idea of ringing bells harmoniously
in any part of France.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XL" id="LETTER_XL"></a>LETTER XL.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lyons</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent">After a month's residence at <i>Avignon</i>,
where I waited till the weather
and roads amongst the high <i>Dauphine</i>
mountains were both improved, I sat out
for this city. I had, you know, outward
bound, dropt down to <i>Port St. Esprit</i> by
water, so it was a new scene to us by land,
and I assure you it was a fine one; the vast
and extensive rich vales, adorned on all
sides with such romantic mountains, could
not be otherwise, in such a climate. Our
first stage was only four leagues to <i>Orange</i>;
this is the last town in the Pope's territories;
and within a quarter of a mile of it
stands, in a corn field, a beautiful Roman
triumphal arch, so great in <i>ruins</i>, that it
would be an ornament even in Rome. The
<i>Palais Royal</i> at this town, has nothing to
recommend it, but that it affords a prospect
of this rich morsel of antiquity.</p>

<p>From <i>Orange</i> we passed through <i>Pierlaite,
Donzeir</i>, and several smaller towns,
and we lay one night at a single house,
but an excellent auberge, called <i>Souce</i>,
kept by an understanding sensible host.</p>

<p>At a little village called <i>A'tang</i>, on the
banks of the Rhone, we stopped a day or
two, to enjoy the sweet situation. Just
opposite to it, on the other side of the river,
stands a large town, (<i>Tournau</i>,) which
added to the beauty of our village, over
which hangs a very high mountain, from
whence the best Hermitage wine is collected:
I suppose it is called <i>Hermitage</i>,
from a Hermit's cell on the top of it; but
so unlike the <i>Montserrat</i> Hermitages, that
I contented myself with only tasting the
Hermit's wine; it was so good indeed,
that though I did not see how it was possible
to get it safe to the north side of
France, I could not withstand the temptation
of buying a cask, for which I was to
pay twelve guineas, and did pay one as earnest,
to a very sensible, and I believe honest
and opulent wine merchant, who, however,
made me a present of two bottles when
I came away, almost worth my guinea; it
is three livres a bottle on the spot; and he
shewed me orders he had received from
men of fashion in England, for wine; among
which was one from Mr. <i>Ryder</i>, Sir
<i>Dudley Ryder</i>'s son I fancy, who, I found,
was well satisfied with his former dealings.
Do you know that Claret is greatly improved
by a mixture of Hermitage, and
that the best Claret we have in England
is generally so <i>adulterated</i>?</p>

<p>The next towns we passed were <i>Pevige</i>
and <i>Vienne</i>, the latter only five leagues
from this city. It is a very ancient town,
and was formerly a Roman colony. The
cathedral is a large and noble Gothic
structure, and in it is a fine tomb of Cardinal
<i>Mountmoin</i>, said to be equal in workmanship
to <i>Richlieu</i>'s in the <i>Sorbonne</i>, but
said to be so, by people no ways qualified
to judge properly; it is indeed an expensive
but a miserable performance, when
put in competition with the works of <i>Girrardeau</i>.
About half a mile without the
town is a noble pyramidal Roman monument,
said to have stood in the center of
the Market-place, in the time of the Romans.
There is also to be seen in this
town, a Mosaic pavement discovered only
a few years since, wonderfully beautiful
indeed, and near ten feet square, though
not quite perfect, being broken in the
night by some malicious people, out of mere
wantonness, soon after it was discovered.</p>

<p>At this town I was recommended to the
<i>Table Round</i>; but as there are two, the
<i>grande</i> and the <i>petit</i>, I must recommend
you to the <i>petit</i> where I was obliged to
move; for, of all the dreadful women I
ever came near, Madam <i>Rousillion</i> has the
<i>least mellifluous</i> notes; her ill behaviour,
however, procured me the honour of a
very agreeable acquaintance, the <i>Marquis
DeValan</i>, who made me ashamed, by shewing
us an attention we had no right to expect;
but this is one, among many other
agreeable circumstances, which attend
strangers travelling in France. French
gentlemen never see strangers ill treated,
without standing forth in their defence;
and I hope English gentlemen will follow
their example, because it is a piece of justice
due to strangers, in whatever country
they are, or whatever country they are
from; it is doing as one would be done by.
That prejudice which prevails in England,
even among some people of fashion, against
the French nation is illiberal, in the highest
degree; nay, it is more, it is a national
disgrace.&mdash;When I recollect with what
ease and uninterruption I have passed
through so many great and little towns,
and extensive provinces, without a symptom
of wanton rudeness being offered me,
I blush to think how a Frenchman, if he
made no better figure than I did, would
have been treated in a tour through Britain.&mdash;My
Monkey, with a pair of French
jack boots, and his hair <i>en queue</i>, rode
postillion upon my sturdy horse some hours
every day; such a sight, you may be sure,
brought forth old and young, sick and
lame, to look at him and his master. <i>Jocko</i>
put whole towns in motion, but never
brought any affront on his master; they
came to look and to laugh, but not to deride
or insult. The post-boys, it is true,
did not like to see their fraternity <i>taken
off</i>, in my <i>little Theatre</i>; but they seldom
discovered it, but by a grave salutation;
and sometimes a good humoured fellow
called him comrade, and made <i>Jocko</i> a
bow; they could not laugh at his bad seat,
for not one of them rode with more ease;
or had a handsomer laced jacket. Mr.
<i>Buffon</i> says, the Monkey or <i>Maggot</i>, (and
mine is the latter, for he has no tail) make
their grimace or chattering equally to shew
their anger or to make known their appetite.
With all due deference to this great
naturalist, I must beg leave to say, that his
observation is not quite just; there is as
much difference between the grimace of
my <i>Jocko</i>, when he is angry or hungry,
and when he grins to shew delight, as there
is in a man, when he gnashes his teeth in
wrath, or laughs from mirth.</p>

<p>Between <i>Avignon</i> and this town I met a
dancing bear, mounted by a <i>Maggot</i>: as it
was upon the high road, I desired leave to
present <i>Jocko</i> to his grandfather, for so
he appeared both in age and size; the interview,
though they were both males, was
very affecting; never did a father receive a
long-lost child with more seeming affection
than the <i>old gentleman</i> did my <i>Jocko</i>; he
embraced him with every degree of tenderness
imaginable, while the <i>young gentleman</i>
(like other young gentlemen of the
present age) betrayed a perfect indifference.
In my conscience I believe it, there was
some consanguinity between them, or the
reception would have proved more mutual.
Between you and me, I fear, were I
to return to England, I might find myself
a sad party in such an interview. It is a sad
reflection; but perhaps Providence may
wisely ordain such things, in order as men
grow older, to wean them from the objects
of their worldly affections, that they
may resign more readily to the decree of
fate. That good man, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
did not seem to dread the approach of
death on his own account, so much as
from the grievous affliction <span class="smcap">he</span> had reason
to fear it would bring upon his children
and family.</p>

<p>The above harangue, made by <span class="smcap">Claudius</span>,
in favor of the <span class="smcap">Lyonoise</span>, and
which he pronounced in the Senate, is the
only remains of the works of this Emperor,
though he composed many. <i>Suetonius</i>
says he composed forty-three books of a history,
and left eight compleat of his own
life; and adds, that he wrote more elegantly
than judiciously.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_XLII" id="LETTER_XLII"></a>LETTER XLII.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lyons.</span></p>


<p class="noindent">I have now spent a month in my second
visit to this great and flourishing city, and
fortunately took lodgings in a <i>Hotel</i>, where
I found the lady and sister of <i>Mons. Le
Marquis De Valan</i>, whose politeness to us I
mentioned in a former letter at <i>Vienne</i>,
and by whose favour I have had an opportunity
of seeing more, and being better
informed, than I could have been without
so respectable an acquaintance. At
<i>Vienne</i> I only knew his rank, here I became
acquainted with his good character,
and fortune, which is very considerable in
<i>Dauphine</i>, where he has two or three fine
seats. His Lady came to <i>Lyons</i> to lye-in,
attended by the Marquis's sister, a <i>Chanoinesse</i>,
a most agreeable sensible woman,
of a certain age; but the Countess is
young and beautiful.</p>

<p>You may imagine that, after what I said
of <i>Lyons</i>, on my way <i>to</i> Spain, I did not
associate much with my own country-folks.
On my return, indeed, my principal amusement
was to see as much as I could, in a
town where so much is to be seen; and in
relating to you what I have seen, I will begin
with the <i>Hotel De Ville</i>; if it had not
that name, I should have called it a Palace,
for there are few palaces so large or so noble;
on the first entrance of which, in the
vestibule, you see, fixed in the wall, a large
plate of Bronze, bearing stronger marks of
fire than of age; on which were engraven,
seventeen hundred years ago, two harangues
made by the Emperor <i>Claudius</i> in
the senate, in favour of the <i>Lyonoise</i>, and
which are not only legible at this day, but
all the letters are sharp and well executed;
the plate indeed is broke quite through
the middle, but fortunately the fraction
runs between the first and second harangues,
so as to have done but little injury among the
the letters. As I do not know whether
you ever saw a copy of it, I inclose it to
you, and desire you will send it as an agreeable
exercise, to be well translated by
my friend at Oxford.</p>

<p>On the other side of the vestibule is a
noble stair-case, on which is well painted
the destruction of the city, by so dreadful
a fire in the time of the Romans, that <i>Seneca</i>,
who gives an account of it in a letter to
his friend, says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Una nox fuit inter urbem maximam et
nullum.</i>"</p>

<p>i.e. One night only intervened between
a great city and nothing.</p></div>

<p>There is something awful in this scene,
to see on one side of the stair-case the conflagration
well executed; on the other,
strong marks of the very fire which burnt
so many ages ago; for there can be no
doubt, but that the Bronze plate then
stood in the <i>Roman Hotel de Ville</i>, and was
burnt down with it, because it was dug up
among the refuse of the old city on the
mountain called <i>Fourvire</i>, on the other
side of the river, where the original city
was built.&mdash;In cutting the letters on this
large plate of Bronze, they have, to gain
room, made no distance between the words,
but shewn the division only by a little
touch thus &lt; with the graver; and where
a word eroded with a C, or G, they have
put the touch within the concavity of the
letter, otherwise it is admirably well executed.</p>

<p>Upon entering into the long gallery above
stairs, you are shewn the late King
and Queen's pictures at full length, surrounded
with the heads of some hundred
citizens; and in one corner of the room
an ancient altar, the <i>Taurabolium</i>, dug up
in 1704, near the same place where <i>Claudius's</i>
harangue was found; it is of common
stone, well executed, about four feet
high, and one foot and a half square; on
the front of it is the bull's head, in demi
relief, adorned with a garland of corn;
on the right side is the <i>victimary</i> knife<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> of
a very singular form; and on the left the
head of a ram, adorned as the bull's; near
the point of the knife are the following
words, <i>cujus factum est</i>; the top of the altar
is hollowed out into the form of a
shallow bason, in which, I suppose, incense
was burnt and part of the victims.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">A</span></a> The knife, which is cut in demi relief, on the
<i>Taurobolium</i>, is crooked upon the back, exactly in the
same manner, and form, as may be seen on some of
the medals of the Kings of Macedonia.</p></div></div>

<p>The Latin inscription under the bull's
head, is very well cut, and very legible,
by which it appears, that by the express
order of <span class="smcap">Cybele</span>, the reputed mother of
the Gods, for the honour and health of
the Emperor <i>Antoninus Pius</i>, father of his
country, and for the preservation of his children,
children, <i>Lucius &AElig;milius Carpus</i><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">B</a> received
the horns of the bull, by the ministration
of <i>Quintus Samius Secundus</i>, transported
them to the Vatican, and consecrated, at
his own expence, this altar and the head
of the bull<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">C</a>; but I will send the inscription,
and a model<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">D</a> of the altar, as soon as
I can have it made, as I find here a very
ingenious sculptor and modeller; who, to
my great serprize, says no one has hitherto
been taken from it. And here let me
observe, lest I forget it, to say, that <i>Augustus</i>
lived three years in this city.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">B</span></a> <i>Lucius &AElig;milius Carpus</i> was a Priest, and a man
of great riches: he was of the quality of <i>Sacrovir</i>,
and probably one of the six Priests of the temple of
Angustus.&mdash;<i>Sextumvir Augustalii</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">C</span></a> Several inscriptions of this kind have been
found both in Italy and Spain, but by far the greater
number among the Gauls; and as the sacrifices
to the Goddess Cybele were some of the least ancient
of the Pagan rites, so they were the last which
were suppressed on the establishment of Christianity.
Since we find one of the Taurobolian
inscriptions, with so recent a date as the time of
the Emperor Valentinian the third. The silence of
the Heathen writers on this head is very wonderful;
for the only one who makes any mention of them
is Julius Firmicus Maternus, in his dissertation
on the errors of the Pagan religion; as Dalenius,
in his elaborate account of the Taurobolium, has
remarked.
</p><p>
The ceremony of the consecration of the High
Priest of Cybele, which many learned men have
mistaken for the consecration of the Roman Pontifex
Maximus; which dignity, from the very earliest
infancy of the Roman Empire, was always annexed
to that of the Emperor himself.
</p><p>
The Priests who had the direction of the Taurobola,
wore the same vestments without washing out
the bloody stains, as long as they would hold together.
</p><p>
By these rites and baptisms by blood, they
thought themselves, as it were re-born to a life eternal.
Sextilius Agefilaus &AElig;desius says, that he was
born a-new, to life eternal, by means of the Taurobolium
and Criobolium.
</p><p>
Nor were the priests alone initiated in this manner,
but also others, who were not of that order; in
particular cases the regenerations were only promised
for twenty years.
</p><p>
Besides the Taurobolia and Criobolia, which
were erected at the expence of whole cities and provinces,
there were others also, which were founded
by the bounty of private people. We often meet
with the names of magistrates and priests of other
Gods, who were admitted into these mysteries, and
who erected Taurobolia as offerings for the safety of
the Emperor, or their own. The rites of the Taurobolia
lasted sometimes many days.
</p><p>
The inscription, on the Taurobolium, which is
on the same side with the head of the bull, we have
endeavoured to explain by filling up the abbreviations
which are met with in the Roman character.

Dr. <span class="smcap">Harrington</span> <i>at Bath</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Taurobolium</i> was one of the great
mysteries, you know, of the Roman religion,
in the observance of which, I think,
they dug a large hole in the earth, and
covered it with planks, laid at certain distances,
so as to give light into the subterranean
temple. The person who was to
receive the <i>Taurobolio</i> then descended into
the theatre, and received on his head and
whole body, the smoaking hot blood of
the bull, which was there sacrificed for that
purpose. If a single bull was only sacrificed,
I think they call it a simple <i>Taurabolio</i>,
if a ram was added to it, as was
sometimes done, it was then called a <i>Torobolia</i>,
and <i>Criobolio</i>; sometimes too, I believe
a goat was also slain.</p>

<p>After all the blood of the victim animals
was discharged, the Priests and Cybils
retired beneath the theatre, and he
who had received the bloody sacrifice,
came forth and exposed himself, besmeared
with blood, to the people, who all prostrated
themselves before him, with reverential
awe, as one who was thereby particularly
sanctified, and whose person ought
to be regarded with the highest veneration,
and looked upon with holy horror; nor did
this sanctification, I think, end with the
ceremony, but rendered the person of the
sanctified holy for twenty years. An inscription
cited by <i>Gruter</i>, seems to confirm
this matter, who, after speaking of
one <i>Nepius Egnatius Faventinus</i>, who lived
in the year of Christ 176, says,</p>

<p><i>"Percepto Taurobolio Criobolioque feliciter,</i>"</p>

<p>Concludes with these words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>"Vota Faventinus bis deni suscipit orbis,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Ut mactet repetens aurata fronte bicornes.</i>"</div>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>bis denus orbis</i> seems to imply, the
space of twice ten years.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help making a little
comparison between the honours paid by
the Roman citizens to their Emperors,
and those of the present times to the Princes
of the Blood Royal. You must know
that the present King's brother, came to
<i>Lyons</i> in the year 1775, and thus it is recorded
in letters of gold upon their quay:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">LOUIS XVI. REGNANT.</div>

<p>If the <i>Bourgeoise</i> of <i>Lyons</i>, however, are
not men of genius, they are ingenious
men, and they have a most delightful
country to dwell in. I think I may say,
that from the high hills which hang about
this city, and taking in the rivers, fertile
vales, rude rocks, vine-yards, and country
seats, far and near, that <i>Lyons</i> and its environs,
afford a greater variety of natural
and artificial beauties, than any spot in
Europe. It is, however, by no means a
place for the winter residence of a stranger.
Most of the natives advanced in years, were
carried off last winter. The surly winds
which come down the Rhone, with impetuous
blasts, are very disagreeable and
dangerous. I found the cold intolerable
in the beginning of May, out of the sunshine,
and the sun intolerable in it. In
England I never wore but one under waistcoat;
in Spain, and in the south of France,
I found two necessary. The Spaniards
wear long cloaks, and we laugh at them;
but the laugh would come more properly
from them. There is in those climates a
<i>vifness</i> in the air that penetrates through
and through; and I am sure that such who
travel to the southward for the recovery
of their health, ought to be ten times more
upon their guard, to be well secured against
the keen blasts the south of France, than
even against an easterly wind in England.</p>

<p>The disorder which carried off so many
last winter at <i>Lyons</i>, was called the Gripe.
In a large hotel only one person escaped
it, an English Lady. They called it the
<i>Gripe</i>, from the fast hold it took of the
person it seized; nor did it let them go till
April.</p>

<p>On my way here, I found it sometimes
extremely hot; it is now the first of May,
and I am shaking by the side of a good
fire, and have had one constantly every
day for this fortnight.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Lyonoise</i> think their town was
particularly honoured by the <i>Taurobolium</i>;
but it was a common practice to offer that
sacrifice not only for the Emperor's health,
but for the preservation of a city. There
are two of these altars in the town of <i>Letoure</i>;
one consecrated for the preservation
of the Emperor <i>Gordian</i>, on which is the
following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">PRO SALVTE IMP. ANTONINI GORDIANO PII FEL.</div>
<div class="i1">AVG. TOTIVSQVE DOMVS DIVIN&AElig; PROQVE STATV CIVIT.</div>

<div class="i6">EROTIO ET FESTO CANINIS SACERD.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in a little village near <i>Marseilles</i>,
called <i>Pennes</i>, there is a stone, on which
is engraven,</p>

<p>
MATRI DEVM MAGN&AElig; IDE&AElig;
</p>

<p>And on another, in the same town,</p>

<p>
MATRI DEVM TAVROPOLIVM.
</p>

<p>I must not omit to give you a copy of a
singular inscription on the tomb of a mint-master
which was found in <i>Lyons</i>, and is
preserved entire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">NOBILIS TIB. C&AElig;SARIUS AVG. SER &AElig;Q. MONET HIC</div>
<div class="i2">AD QVI LOCIT JVLIA ADEPTA CONJUNX ET</div>
<div class="i6">PERPETUA FILIA D.S.D.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The most ancient money which has been
found in and about this city, is the little
coin of <i>Mark Antony</i>; on one side of
which is represented the Triumvirate; on
the other, a Lion, with the word <i>Lugudani</i>
under it; on each side of the Lion are
the letters A and XL. The antiquarians
here think those letters marked the value
of the piece, and that it was about forty
<i>sous</i>; but is it not more probable, that this
was only the mint-master's touch?</p>

<p>Nothing can be a stronger proof of the
importance of this city in the time of the
Romans, than the immense expence
they were at in erecting such a number of
grand aqu&aelig;ducts, one of which was eighteen
leagues in length; many parts of
them are still visible; and it appears that
they spent for the reparation of them at
<i>one</i> time, near one thousand talents;
and here it was that the four grand Roman
highways divided; one of which
went directly to the sea, and another to
the <i>Pyrenees</i>.</p>

<p><i>Agrippa</i>, who was the constructor of
most of these noble monuments of Roman
grandeur, would not permit the <i>Lyonoise</i> to
erect any monument among them to his
memory; and yet, his memory is, in a very
particular manner, preserved to this day in
the very heart of the city, for in the front
of a house on the quay <i>de Villeroy</i>, is a medallion
of baked earth, which, I think,
perfectly resembles him; sure I am it is an
unquestionable antique; it is a little disfigured
indeed, and disgraced by his name
being written upon it in modern characters.
But there is another monument of
<i>Agrippa</i> here; it is part of the epitaph of
an officer or soldier of the third cohort,
whose duty it was to take an account of
the expence of each day for the subsistence
of the troops employed to work on
the high-ways, and this officer was called
<i>A. Rationibus Agripp&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>There are an infinite number of Roman
inscriptions preserved at <i>Lyons</i>, among
which is the following singular one:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">DIIS INIQVIS QUI ANIMVLAM</div>
<div class="i2">TVAM RAPVERVNT.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I have already told you of a modern
monument erected by the <i>Lyonoise</i>, and
now, with grief and concern, I must tell
you of an ancient one which they have
demolished! it was a most beautiful structure,
called the tomb of the Two Lovers;
that, however, was a mistake; it was the
tomb of a brother and sister named <i>Amandas</i>,
or <i>Amans</i>, for near where it stood was
lately found the following monumental
inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  M</div>
<div class="i0">ET MEMORIAE &AElig;TERN&AElig; OLI&AElig; TRIBVT&AElig;</div>
<div class="i2">FEMIN&AElig; SANCTISSIME ARVESCIVS</div>
<div class="i1">AMANDVS FRATER SORORI KARISSM&AElig;</div>
<div class="i3">SIBIQVE AMANTISSIM&AElig; P.C. ET</div>
<div class="i5">SVB OSCIA DEDICAVIT.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I have seen a beautiful drawing of this
fine monument, which stood near the high
road, a little without the town; the barbarian
<i>Bourgeoises</i> threw it down about seventy
years ago, to search for treasure.</p>

<p>But enough of antiquities; and therefore
I will tell you truly my sentiments
with respect to the south of France, which
is, that <i>Lyons</i> is quite southward enough
for an Englishman, who will, if he goes
farther, have many wants which cannot be
supplied. After quitting <i>Lyons</i>, he will
find neither good butter, milk, or cream.
At <i>Lyons</i>, every thing, which man can
wish for, is in perfection; it is indeed a
rich, noble, and plentiful town, abounding
with every thing that is good, and
more <i>finery</i> than even in <i>Paris</i> itself. They
have a good theatre, and some tolerable
actors; among whom is the handsomest
Frenchman I ever beheld, and, a little
stiffness excepted, a good actor.</p>

<p>Any young gentleman traveller, particularly
<i>of the English nation</i>, who is desirous
of <i>replenishing his purse</i>, cannot, even
in <i>Paris</i>, find more convenient occasions
to throw himself in <i>fortune's way</i>, than at
the city of <i>Lyons</i>.</p>

<p>An English Lady, and two or three gentlemen,
have lately been so <i>fortunate there</i>,
as to find lodgings <i>at a great Hotel</i>, gratis;
and I desire you will particularly <i>recommend
a long stay at</i> Lyons <i>to my Oxonian
friend</i>; where he may <i>see the world</i> without
looking out at a window.</p>

<p>I find I omitted to give you before I
left <i>Nismes</i>, some account of Monsieur <i>Seguier</i>'s
cabinet, a gentleman whose name
I have before mentioned, and whose conversation
and company were so very agreeable
to me. Among an infinite number
of natural and artificial curiosities, are
many ancient Roman inscriptions, one of
which is that of <i>T. Julius Festus</i>, which
<i>Spon</i> mentions in his <i>Melanges D'Antiquite</i>.
There are also a great number of Roman
utensils of bronze, glass, and earthen-ware.
The Romans were well acquainted with
the dangerous consequences of using copper
vessels<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">E</a> in their kitchens, as may be
seen in this collection, where there are a
great many for that purpose; but all strongly
gilt, not only within, but without, to
prevent a possibility of <i>verdigris</i> arising.
There is also a bronze head of a Colossal
statue, found not many years since near
the fountain of <i>Nismes</i>, which merits particular
attention, as well as a great number
of Roman and Greek medals and medallions,
well preserved, and some which
are very rare. The natural curiosities are
chiefly composed of fossils and petrifications;
among the latter, are an infinite
number of petrified fish <i>embalmed</i> in solid
stones; and where one sees the finest membranes
of the fins, and every part of the
fish, delineated by the pencil of nature, in
the most exquisite manner; the greater
part of these petrifications were collected
by the hands of the possessor, some from
<i>Mount Bola</i>, others from <i>Mount Liban</i>,
<i>Switzerland</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">E</span></a> See Dr. <span class="smcap">Falconer</span>, of <i>Bath</i>, his Treatise on
this subject.</p></div></div>

<p>Mr. <i>Seguier</i>'s <i>Herbary</i> consists of more
than ten thousand plants; but above all,
Mr. <i>Seguier</i> himself, is the first, and most
valuable part of his cabinet, having spent
a long life in rational amusements; and
though turned of four-score, he has all the
chearfulness of youth, without any of the
garrulity of old age. When he honoured
me with a visit, at my country lodgings,
he came on foot, and as the waters were
out, I asked him how he <i>got at me</i>, so dry
footed? He had walked upon the wall, he
said; a wall not above nine inches thick,
and of a considerable length!</p>

<p>And here let me observe that a Frenchman
eats his <i>soup</i> and <i>bouille</i> at twelve
o'clock, drinks only <i>with</i>, not <i>after</i> his
dinner, and then mixes water with his <i>genuine</i>
wine; he lives in a fine climate,
where there is not as with us, for six weeks
together, easterly winds, which stop the
pores, and obstruct perspiration. A
Frenchman eats a great deal, it is true, but
it is not all <i>hard meat</i>, and they never sit
and drink after dinner or supper is over.&mdash;An
Englishman, on the contrary, drinks
much stronger, and a variety of fermented
liquors, and often much worse, and sits
<i>at it</i> many hours after dinner, and always
after supper. How then can he expect
such health, such spirits, and to enjoy a
long life, free from pain, as most Frenchmen
do; When the negro servants in the
West-Indies find their masters call <i>after</i>
dinner for a bowl of punch extraordinary
they whisper them, (if company are present)
and ask, "<i>whether they drink for
drunk</i>, or <i>drink for dry</i>?" A Frenchman
never drinks for <i>drunk</i>.&mdash;While the Englishman
is earning disease and misery at
his bottle, the Frenchman is embroidering
a gown, or knitting a handkerchief
for his mistress. I have seen a Lady's
sacque finely <i>tamboured</i> by a Captain of
horse, and a Lady's white bosom shewn
through mashes netted by the man who
made the snare, in which he was himself
entangled; though he made it he did not
perhaps know the powers of it till she <i>set
it</i>.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_XLV" id="LETTER_XLV"></a>LETTER XLV.</h2>


<p>I write to you just as things come into
my head, having taken very few notes,
and those, as you must perceive, often
without much regard to <i>unison</i> or <i>time</i>. It
has this minute occurred to me, that I omitted
to tell you on my journey onwards,
that I visited a little town in <i>Picardie</i>,
called <i>Ham</i>, where there is so strong a
castle, that it may be called a <i>petit Bastile</i>,
and which was then and still is, full of
state prisoners and debtors. To this castle
there is a monstrous tower, the walls
of which are thirty six feet thick, and the
height and circumference are proportionable
thereto; it was built by the <i>Conetable
de St. Paul</i>, in order to shut up his master,
<i>Charles</i> the VIth, King of France, and contemporary,
I think, with our <i>Henry</i> the
Vth; but such are the extraordinary turns
of all human affairs, that <i>Mons. le Conetable</i>
was shut up in it himself many years, and
ended his days there.&mdash;The fate of this
constable brings to my mind a circumstance
that happened under my <i>administration</i>,
at <i>Land-Guard Fort</i>, when the King
was pleased to trust me with the command
of it. I had not been twenty-four hours
in possession of what I thought a small
sovereignty, before I received a letter in
the following terms:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>, Having observed horses grazing
on the covered way, that <i>hath</i> done apparent
damage, and may do more, I
think it my duty to inform you, that his
Majesty does not permit horses to feed
thereon, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Signed)</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">"Anthony Goode</span>,<br />
Overseer of the Works."
</p>

<p>I never was more surprized, than to find
my wings were to be thus clipt, by a civil
officer of the board of ordnance; however
wrong I or my horses had acted, I could
not let Mr. <span class="smcap">Goode</span> <i>graze</i> so closely upon
my authority, without a reprimand; I
therefore wrote him an answer in terms as
follow: "that having seen a fat impudent-looking
strutting fellow about the garrison,
it was my order that when his duty
led him to communicate any thing to
me relative to the works thereof, that
he came himself, instead of writing impertinent
letters." Mr. <i>Goode</i> sent a copy
of his letter and mine to Sir <i>Charles
Frederick</i>; and the post following, he received
from the Office of Ordnance, several
printed papers in the King's name, forbidding
horses grazing on the <span class="smcap">works</span>, and
<i>ordering Mr. Goode</i> to nail those orders up
in different parts of the garrison! but as I
had not then learnt that either he, or his
<i>red ribband master</i>, had any authority to
give out, even the King's orders, in a garrison
I commanded, but through my hands,
I took the liberty, while Mr. <i>Goode</i> and
his assistant-son were nailing one up <i>opposite
to my parlour window</i>, to send for a file
of men and put them both into the Black-hold,
an apartment Mr. <i>Goode</i> had himself
built, being a Master-Mason. By the time
he had been ten minutes <i>grazing</i> under
this <i>covered way</i>, he sent me a message,
that he was <i>asthmatic</i>, that the place was
too close, and that if he died within a <i>year
and a day</i>, I must be deemed accessary to
his death. But as I thought Mr. <i>Goode</i>
should have considered, that some of the
poor invalids too might now and then be
as subject to the asthma as he, it was a
proper punishment, and I kept him there
till he knew the duty of a soldier, as well
as that of a mason; and as I would <i>his
betters</i>, had they come down and ventured
to have given out orders in a garrison under
my command; but instead of getting
me punished as a <i>certain gentleman</i> aimed
at, that able General <i>Lord Ligonier</i> approved
my conduct, and removed the
man to another garrison, and would have
dismissed him the ordnance service, had I
not become a petitioner in his favour; for
he was too fat and old to work, too proud
and arrogant to beg, and he and <i>his advisers</i>
too contemptible to be angry with.&mdash;But
I must return to the castle of <i>Ham</i>,
to tell you what a dreadful black-hold there
is in that tower; it is a trap called by the
French <i>des Obliettes</i>, of so horrible a contrivance,
that when the prisoners are to
suffer in it, the mechanical powers are so
constructed, as to render it impossible to be
again opened, nor would it signify, but to
see the body <i>molue</i>, i.e. ground to pieces.</p>

<p>There were formerly two or three <i>Obliettes</i>
in this castle; one only now remains;
but there are still several in the <i>Bastile</i>.&mdash;When
a criminal suffers this frightful
death, (for perhaps it is not very painful)
he has no previous notice, but being led
into the apartment, is overwhelmed in an
instant. It is to be presumed, however,
that none but criminals guilty of high
crimes, suffer in this manner; for the state
prisoners in the <i>Bastile</i> are not only well
lodged, but liberal tables are kept for them.</p>

<p>An Irish officer was lately enlarged from
the <i>Bastile</i>, who had been twenty-seven
years confined there; and though he found
a great sum of money in the place he had
concealed it in a little before his confinement,
he told Colonel C&mdash;&mdash;, of Fitz-James's
regiment, that "having out-lived
his acquaintance with the world, as well
as with men, he would willingly return
there again."</p>

<p>At <i>Ham</i> the prisoners for debt are quite
separated from the state prisoners; the
latter are in the castle, the former in the
tower.</p>

<p>The death of <i>Lewis</i> the XVth gave liberty
to an infinite number of unhappy
people, and to many who would have been
enlarged before, but had been forgotten.
When one of these unhappy people (a woman
of fashion) was told she might go
out; then, (said she) I am sure <i>Lewis</i> the
XVth is dead; an event she knew nothing
of, tho' it was a full year after the King's
death.&mdash;Things are otherwise conducted
now than in his reign; a wicked vain woman
then commanded with unlimited
power, both in war and domestic concerns.
In this reign, there are able, and
I believe virtuous ministers.</p>

<p>I suppose you think as I did, that Madame
<i>Pompadour</i> governed by her own
powerful charms; but that was not the
case; she governed as many other women
do, by borrowed charms; she had a correspondence
all over the kingdom, and
offices of intelligence, where <i>youth</i>, <i>beauty</i>,
and <i>innocence</i>, were registered, which were
sent to her according to order; upon the
arrival of the <i>goods</i>, they were dressed, and
trained for <i>use</i>, under her inspection, till
they were fit to be <i>shewn up</i>. She had no
regard to birth, for a shoe-maker's daughter
of great beauty, belonging to one of
the Irish brigades, being introduced to
the King, he asked her whether she knew
him? No: she did not: But did you ever
see me before, or any body like me? She
had not, but thought him very like the
face on the <i>gros Eccuis</i> of France. Madame
<i>Pompadour</i> soon found out which of
these girls proved most agreeable to the
King, and such were retained, the others
dismissed.&mdash;The expence of this traffick
was immense. I am assured where difficulties
of birth or fashion fell in the way, ten
thousand pounds sterling have been given.
Had <i>Lewis</i> the XVth lived a few years
longer, he would have ruined his kingdom.
<i>Lewis</i> the XVIth bids fair to aggrandize
it.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLVI" id="LETTER_XLVI"></a>LETTER XLVI.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Post-house, St George</span>, six leagues from
<span class="smcap">Lyons</span>.</p>


<p class="noindent">I am particular in dating this letter, in
hopes that every English traveller may avoid
the place I write from, by either
stopping short, or going beyond it, as it is
the only house of reception for travellers
in the village, and the worst I have met
with in my whole journey. We had been
scurvily treated here as we went; but having
arrived at it after dark, and leaving
it early, I did not recollect it again, till
the mistress by her sour face and sorry
fare betrayed it; for she well remembered
<i>us</i>. As a specimen of French auberge
cookery, I cannot help serving up a dish
of spinnage to you as it was served to me
at this house. We came in early in the afternoon,
and while I was in the court-yard,
I saw a flat basket stand upon the ground,
the bottom of which was covered with
boiled spinnage; and as my dog, and several
others in the yard, had often put
their noses into it, I concluded it was put
down for <i>their</i> food, not <i>mine</i>, till I saw a
dirty girl patting it up into round balls, and
two children, the eldest of them not above
three years old, slavering in and playing
with it, one of whom, <i>to lose no time</i>, was
performing <i>an office</i> that none could <i>do for
her</i>. I asked the maid what she was about,
and what it was she was so preparing? for
I began to think I had been mistaken, till
she told me it was spinnage;&mdash;not for me,
I hope, said I,&mdash;'<i>oui, pour vous et le monde</i>.'
I then forbad her bringing any to my table,
and putting the little girl <i>off her center</i>,
by an angry push, made her almost as dirty
as the spinnage; and I could perceive
her mother, the hostess, and some French
travellers who were near, looked upon me
as a brute, for <i>disturbing la pauvre enfant</i>;
nevertheless, with my <i>entree</i> came up a
dish of this <i>delicate spinnage</i>, with which I
made the girl a very pretty <i>Chapeau Anglois</i>,
for I turned it, dish and all, upon her head;
this set the house in such an uproar, that,
if there had not come in an old gentleman
like <i>Bourgeois</i> of <i>Paris</i>, at that instant,
I verily believe I should have been turned
out; but he engaged warmly in my defence,
and insisted upon it that I had treated
the girl just as he would have done, had
she brought such a dirty dish to him after
being cautioned not to do so; nor should
I have got any supper, had I not prevailed
on this good-natured man, who never eat
any, to order a supper for himself, and transfer
it to me. He was a native of <i>Lyons</i>, and
had been, for the first time after thirty years
absence, to visit his relations there. My entertainment
at this house, <i>outward-bound</i>,
was half a second-hand roasted turkey, or,
what the sailors call a <i>twice-laid</i> dish, i.e.
one which is <i>done over</i> a second time.</p>

<p>I know the French in general will not
like to see this dirty charge, brought even
against an <i>aubergiste</i>, and much less to
hear it said, that this disregard to cleanliness
is almost general in the public inns;
but truth justifies it, and I hope the publication
may amend it.</p>

<p>A modern French anonymous traveller,
who I conclude by the company he kept
in England, is a man of fashion, gives in
general a just account of the English nation,
their customs and manners; and acknowledges,
in handsome terms, the manner
he was received by some of the first
families in England. He owns, however,
he does not understand English, yet he
has the temerity to say, that <i>Gulliver's</i> travels
are the <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of <i>Dean Swift</i>;
but observes, that those travels are greatly
improved by passing through the hands of
<i>Desfontaines</i>.&mdash;This gentleman must excuse
me in saying, that <i>Desfontaines</i> neither
understood English, nor <i>Dean Swift</i>,
better than he does. He also concludes
his first volume, by observing, that what a
French Ambassador to England said of
that nation, in the year 1523, constitutes
their character at this day! 'Alas! poor
England! thou <i>be'st</i> so closely situated, and
in such daily conversation with the polite
and polished nation of France, thou hast
gained nothing of their ease, breeding,
and compliments, in the space of two hundred
and fifty years!'&mdash;What this gentleman
alludes to, is the Ambassador's letter
to the <i>Conetable Montmorency</i>, previous
to the meeting of <i>Henry</i> the Eighth and
<i>Francis</i> the First, near <i>Ardres</i>; for, (says
the Ambassador) <i>sur-tout je vous prie, que
vous ostiez de la Cour, ceux qui unt la reputation
d'etre joyeux &amp; gaudisseur, car c'est
bien en ce monde, la chose la plus haie de cette
nation</i>. And in a few lines after, he foists
in an extract from a Scotchman, one <i>Barclay</i>,
who, in his <i>Examen of Nations</i>, says,
<i>Jenenc connoit point de plus aimable creature,
qui un Fran&ccedil;ois chez qui l'enjoument est
tempore par le judgment, &amp; par discretion</i>;
to all which I subscribe: but such men are
seldom to be met with in any kingdom.</p>

<p>This gentleman says, the most remarkable,
or rather the only act of gaiety he
met with in <i>London</i>, was an harangue
made for an hour in the House of Lords,
previous to the trial of Lord <i>Byron</i>; and
that, as he afterwards understood, it was
made by a drunken member of parliament.
He says it made him and every body laugh
exceedingly; but he laughed only (I presume)
because every body else did, and
relates the story, I fear, merely to make
it a national laugh; for the harangue was
certainly very ill placed, and the mirth it
produced, very indecent, at a time a Peer
of the realm was to be brought forth, accused
of murder; and the untimely death
of a valuable and virtuous young man,
revived in every body's memory.</p>

<p>This is the unfavourable side of what
the gentleman says of the first people in
England. Of the peasants and lower order,
he observes, that, though they are
well fed, well cloathed, and well lodged,
yet they are all of a melancholy turn.&mdash;The
French have no idea of what we call
<i>dry humour</i>; and this gentleman, perhaps,
thought the English clown melancholy,
while he was laughing in his sleeve at the
foppery of his <i>laquais</i>.</p>

<p>These observations put me in mind of
another modern traveller, a man of sense
and letters too, who observes, that the ballustrades
at <i>Westminster</i> bridge are fixed
very close together, to prevent the English
getting through to drown themselves: and
of a Gentleman at <i>Cambridge</i>, who, having
cut a large pigeon-hole under his closet
door, on being asked the use of it, said, he
had it cut for an old cat which had kittens,
to go in and out; but added, <i>that he
must send for the carpenter, to cut little holes
for the young ones</i>. His <i>acute visitor</i> instantly
set up a <i>horse</i> laugh, and asked
him whether the little cats could not come
out at the same hole the big one did? The
other laughing in his turn, said, he did not
<i>think of that</i>.</p>

<p>Though I have spoken with freedom of
this French traveller's remarks, yet I must
own that, in general, he writes and thinks
liberally, and speaks highly of the English
nation, and very gratefully of many individuals
to whom he was known; and, I
dare say, a Frenchman will find many more
mistakes of mine, which I shall be happy
to see pointed out, or rectified: but were I
to pick out the particular objects of laughter,
pity, and contempt, which have fallen
in my way, in twice crossing this great
continent, I could make a second <i>Joe
Miller</i> of one, and a <i>Jane Shore</i> of the other.
If this traveller could have understood
the <i>Beggars' Opera</i>, the <i>humour</i> of
<i>Sam. Foote</i>, or the pleasantry among English
sailors, watermen, and the lower order
of the people, he would have known,
that, though the English nation have not
so much vivacity as the French, they are
behind-hand with no nation whatever,
where true wit and genuine humour are
to be displayed. What would he have
said, could he have seen and entered into
the spirit of the procession of the <i>miserable
Scalds</i>, or Mr. <i>Garrick</i> in <i>Scrub</i>; <i>Shuter</i>,
<i>Woodward</i>, Mrs. <i>Clive</i>, or even our little
<i>Edwin</i> at <i>Bath</i>? Had he seen any of these
things, he must have laughed with the
multitude, as he did in the House of Lords,
though he had not understood it, and
must have seen how inimitably the talents
of these men were formed, to excite so
much mirth and delight, even to a heavy
<i>unpolished</i> English audience.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_XLVII" id="LETTER_XLVII"></a>LETTER XLVII.</h2>


<p>From <i>St. George</i> to <i>Macon</i> is five
leagues. Nothing on earth can be more
beautiful than the face of this country,
far and near. The road lies over a vast and
fertile plain, not far distant from the banks
of the <i>Soane</i> on one side, and adorned
with mountains equally fertile, and beautiful,
on the other. It is very singular,
that all the cows of this part of the country
are white, or of a light dun colour,
and the dress of all the <i>Maconoise</i> peasants
as different from any other province in
France, as that of the Turkish habit; I
mean the women's dress, for I perceived
no difference among the men, but that
they are greater clowns, than any other
French peasants. The women wear a
broad bone lace ruff about their necks,
and a narrow edging of the same sort
round their caps, which are in the form
of the charity girls' caps in England; but
as they must not bind them on with any
kind of ribband, they look rather <i>laid upon</i>
their heads, than <i>dressed upon them</i>; their
gowns are of a very coarse light brown
woollen cloth, made extremely short-waisted,
and full of high and thick plaits
over the hips, the sleeves are rather large,
and turned up with some gaudy coloured
silk; upon the shoulders are sewed several
pieces of worsted livery lace, which seem
to go quite under their arms, in the same
manner as is sometimes put to children to
strengthen their leading-strings; upon the
whole, however, the dress is becoming,
and the very long petticoat and full plaits,
have a graceful appearance.</p>

<p>At <i>Lyons</i> I saw a <i>Macinoise</i> girl of fashion,
or fortune, in this dress; her lace was fine,
her gown silk, and her shoulder-straps of
silver; and, as her head had much more
of the <i>bon gout</i> than the <i>bon ton</i>, I thought
her the most inviting object I had seen in
that city, my delicate landlady at <i>Nismes</i>
always excepted. I think France cannot
produce such another woman <i>for beauty</i> as
<i>Madame Seigny</i>.</p>

<p>I bought a large quantity of the <i>Macon</i>
lace, at about eight-pence English a yard,
which, at a little distance, cannot easily be
distinguished from fine old <i>pointe</i>.</p>

<p>Between <i>St. George</i> and <i>Macon</i>, at a time
we wanted our breakfast, we came to a spot
where two high roads cross each other,
and found there a little <i>cabbin</i>, not unlike
the Iron House, as to whim, but this was
built, sides, top, and bottom, with sawed
boards; and as a little bit of a board hung
out at the door informed us they sold wine,
I went in, and asked the mistress permission
to boil my tea-kettle, and to be permitted
to eat our breakfast in her pretty <i>cabbin</i>?
The woman was knitting; she laid down
her work, rose up, and with the ease and
address of a woman of the first fashion,
said we did her honour, that her house,
such as it was, and every thing in it, were
at our service; she then sent a girl to a farmer's
hard by, for milk, and to a village a
quarter of a league distant, for hot bread;
and while we breakfasted, her conversation
and good breeding made up a principal
part of the <i>repas</i>; she had my horse too
brought to the back part of her <i>cabbin</i>,
where he was well fed from a portable
manger. I bought of her two bottles of
white wine, not much inferior to, and
much wholesomer than, Champaigne, and
she charged me for the whole, milk, bread,
fire, <i>conversation</i>, and wine, thirty six <i>sols</i>,
about seventeen pence English! Though
this gentlewoman, for so I must call her,
and so I believe she is, lived in such a small
hut, she seemed to be in good circumstances,
and had <i>liqueurs</i>, tea, and a great variety
of <i>bons choses</i> to sell. This was the
only public house, (if it maybe called by
that name,) during my whole journey <i>out</i>
and <i>in</i>, where I found perfect civility; not
that the publicans in general have not civility
<i>in their possession</i>, but they will not,
either from <i>pride</i> or <i>design</i>, <i>produce it</i>, particularly
to strangers. My <i>wooden-house
landlady</i> indeed, was a prodigy; and it
must be confessed, that no woman of the
lower order in England, nor even of the
middling class, have any share of that ease
and urbanity which is so common among
the lower order of the <i>people</i> of this kingdom:
but the woman I now speak of, had
not, you will perceive, the least design even
upon my purse; I made no previous agreement
with her for my good fare, and
she scorned to take any advantage of my
confidence; and I shewed my sense of it,
by giving her little maid eight times more
than she ever received for such services
before&mdash;an English shilling.</p>

<p>Let not this single, and singular woman,
however, induce you to trust to the confidence
of a French <i>aubergiste</i> especially a
<i>female</i>; you may as well trust to the conscience
of an itinerant Jew. Frenchmen
are so aware of this, that have heard a
traveller, on a <i>maigre</i> day, make his bargain
for his <i>aumlet</i> and the number of
eggs to be put in it, with an exactness
scarce to be imagined; and yet the upshot
was only two pence English.</p>

<p>The easy manner in which a French officer,
or gentleman, can traverse this mighty
kingdom, either for pleasure or business, is
extremely agreeable, and worthy of imitation
among young British officers.&mdash;In
England, if an Ensign of foot is going a
journey, he must have two horses, and a
groom, though he has nothing but a regimental
suit of cloaths, and half a dozen
shirts to carry; his horses too must <i>set both
ends well</i> because he is a <i>Captain</i> upon the
road! and he travels at about five times
the expence of his pay.</p>

<p>The French officer buys a little <i>biddet</i>,
puts his shirts and best regimental coat
into a little <i>portmanteau</i>, buckles that behind
his saddle, and with his sword by his
side, and his <i>croix</i> at his button-hole, travels
at the expence of about three shillings
a day, and often less, through a kingdom
where every order of people shew
him attention, and give him precedence.</p>

<p>I blush, when I recollect that I have <i>rode</i>
the risque of being wet to the skin because
I would not <i>disgrace my saddle</i>, nor load
my back with a great coat; for I have
<i>formerly</i>, as well as <i>latterly</i>, travelled without
a servant.</p>

<p>I have a letter now before me, which I
received a few days ago from a French
Captain of foot, who says, <i>sur le champ j'ay
fait seller ma petite Rossinante (car vous
scavez que j'ay achete un petit cheval de 90
livres selle et bride) et me voila a Epernay
chez Monsieur Lechet</i>, &amp;c. This gentleman's
whole pay does not amount to more
than sixty pounds a year, yet he has always
five guineas in his pocket, and every
convenience, and some luxuries about him;
he assists now and then an extravagant
brother, appears always well dressed; and
last year I bought him a ticket in the British
lottery: he did not consider that he
employed an unfortunate man to buy it,
and I <i>forgot</i> to remind him of it.</p>

<p>After saying thus much of a virtuous
young man (<i>though a Frenchman</i>) there
will be no harm in telling you his name is
<i>Lalieu</i>, a Captain in the regiment <i>du Maine</i>.&mdash;Before
I took my last leave of him, talking
together of the horrors of war, I asked
him what he would do if he were to see
me <i>vis-a-vis</i> in an hostile manner? He
embraced me, and said, "turn the but
end of my fusee towards you, my friend."
I thank God that neither his <i>but-end</i>, nor
my <i>muzzle</i> can ever meet in that manner,
and I shall be happy to meet him in any
other.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i> I omitted to say, that the <i>Maconoise</i>
female peasants wear black hats, in
the form of the English straw or chip hats;
and when they are tied on, under the chin,
it gives them with the addition of their
round-eared laced cap, a decent, modest
appearance which puts out of countenance
all the borrowed plumage, dead hair,
black wool, lead, grease, and yellow powder,
which is now in motion between <i>Edinburgh</i>
and <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>It is a pity that pretty women, at least,
do not know, that the simplicity of a Quaker's
head-dress, is superior to all that art
can contrive: and those who remember
the elegant <i>Miss Fide</i>, a woman of that
persuasion, will subscribe to the truth of
my assertion. And it is still a greater pity,
that plain women do not know, that the
more they adorn and <i>artify</i> their heads,
the more conspicuous they make their natural
defects.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLVIII" id="LETTER_XLVIII"></a>LETTER XLVIII.</h2>


<p>At <i>Challons sur la Soane</i>, (for there is
another town of the same name in <i>Champaigne</i>)
I had the <i>honor</i> of a visit from
<i>Mons. le Baron Shortall</i>, a gentleman of an
ancient family, <i>rather in distress at this
time</i>, by being <i>kept out</i> of six and thirty
thousand a year, his legal property in Ireland;
but as the Baron made his visit<i>ala-mode
de capuchin Friar</i>, without knocking,
and when only the female part of my family
were in the apartment, he was dismissed
<i>rather abruptly</i> for a man of <i>his high
rank</i> and <i>great fortune in expectation</i>. This
dismission, however, did not dismay him;
he rallied again, with the reinforcement of
<i>Madame la Baroness</i>, daughter, as he positively
affirmed, of <i>Mons. le Prince de Monaco</i>;
but as I had forbad his being <i>shewn
up</i>, he desired me to <i>come down</i>, a summons
curiosity induced me to obey. Never,
surely, were two people <i>of fashion</i> in a
more pitiable plight! he was in a <i>russet
brown black</i> suit of cloaths; Madame <i>la
Baroness</i> in much the same colour, wrapt
up in a tattered black silk capuchin; and
I knew not which to admire most, their
folly or their impudence; for surely never
did an <i>adventurer</i> set out with less <i>capabilities</i>
about him; his whole story was so
flagrant a fib, that in spite of the <i>very respectable
certificates of My Lord Mayor, John
Wilkes, and Mr. Alderman Bull</i>, I was obliged
to tell him plainly, that I did not
believe him to be a gentleman, nor his wife
to be a relation of the Prince of <i>Monaco</i>.
All this he took in good part, and then assured
me they were both very hungry,
and without meat or money; I therefore
ordered a dinner at twenty <i>sols</i> a head;
and, as I sat by while they eat it, I had
reason to believe that he told me <i>one plain
truth</i>, for in truth they eat as if they had
never eaten before. After dinner the Baron
did me the honour to consult with me <i>how</i>
he should get down to <i>Lyons</i>? I recommended
to him to proceed by <i>water</i>; but,
said he, my dear Sir, I have no money;&mdash;an
evil I did not chuse to redress; and,
after several unsuccessful attempts at my
purse, and some at my person,&mdash;he whispered
me that even six livres would be acceptable;
but I held out, and got off, by
proposing that the Baroness should write a
letter to the Prince her father, to whom I
had the honour to be known, and that I
would carry him the letter, and enforce
their prayer, by making it my own. This
measure she instantly complied with, and
addressed her father <i>adorable Prince</i>; but
concluded it with a name which could not
belong to her either as maid, wife, or widow.
I remarked this to the <i>Baron</i>, who
acknowledged at once <i>the mistake</i>, said she
had signed a false name, and she should
write it over again; but when I observed to
him that, as the Prince knew the handwriting
of his <i>own</i> dear child, and as the
name of women is <i>often varying by marriage</i>,
or <i>miscarriage</i>, it was all one: to this
he agreed; and I brought off the letter,
and my purse too, for forty <i>sols</i>; yet there
was so much falshood, folly, and simplicity
in this <i>simple pair of adventurers</i>, that I
sorely repented I did not give them their
passage in the <i>coche d'eau</i> to <i>Lyons</i>; for he
could not speak a word of French, nor
<i>Madame la Baroness</i> a word of English; and
the only <i>insignia</i> of distinction between
them, was, a vast clumsy brass-hilted sword
which the Baron, instead of wearing at his
side, held up at his nose, like a Physician's
gold-headed cane.&mdash;When I took my
leave of this <i>Sir James Shortall</i>, (for he
owned <i>at last</i> he was <i>only a Baronet</i>) he
promised to meet me <i>next time</i> dressed in
his blue and silver.</p>

<p>I verily believe my Irish <i>adventurer</i> at
<i>Perpignan</i>, is a gentleman, and therefore I
relieved him; I am thoroughly persuaded
my <i>Challons</i> adventurer is not, yet perhaps
he was a real object of charity, and his true
tale would have produced him better success
than his <i>borrowed story</i>. <i>Sir James</i>
was about sixty, <i>Lady Shortall</i> about fifty.&mdash;<i>Sir
James</i> too had a pretty large property
in America, and would have visited
his estates on that continent, had I not
informed him of the present unhappy differences
now subsisting between that and
the mother country, of which he had not
heard a single syllable.</p>


<p>After having said thus much, I think I
must treat you with a copy of <i>Lady Shortall's</i>
letter, a name very applicable to their
unhappy situation, for they did indeed
seem short of every thing;&mdash;so here it is,

<h2><a name="LETTER_XLIX" id="LETTER_XLIX"></a>LETTER XLIX.</h2>


<p>From <i>Challons</i> to <i>Bonne</i>, is five leagues.
<i>Bonne</i> is a good town, well walled-in, pleasantly
situated, and remarkable for an excellent
and well-conducted Hospital, where
the poor sick are received <i>gratis</i>, without
distinction, and where the rich sick are accommodated
with nurses, physicians, medicines,
food, and lodging, with every assistance
that can be wanted, for four livres
a day. The apartments in which the poor
are received, are so perfectly clean and
sweet, that they are fit for people of any
condition; but those provided for the better
sort, are indeed sumptuously furnished.
The women who act as nurses, are of a religious
order, and wear a particular, decent,
and uniform habit, to which their
modest deportment exactly coincides; yet
most of them are young, and many of
them very beautiful.</p>

<p>Between these two towns we met an
English servant, in a rich laced livery, conducting,
behind a post-chaise, a large quantity
of baggage; and soon after, a second
servant, in the same uniform; this excited
our curiosity, and we impatiently proceeded,
in hopes of meeting the equipage,
which it was natural to expect would soon
follow; instead of which, it was an old
English four-wheel chaise, the <i>contents</i> of
which were buckled close up behind a pair
of dirty leather curtains; and on the coach-box
sat, by the side of the driver, a man
who had the appearance of an English farmer.
This contrast rather increased than
lessened our curiosity; and, therefore, at
<i>Bonne</i>, I made some enquiry about them
of the post-master; who told me they came
in, and set off, separately, just as I had met
them; but that one servant paid for the
horses to all the carriages, and that the woman
<i>behind the curtain, according to custom,
did not chuse to shew herself</i>. Just as I was
returning with this blind account, an English
servant, who I had not perceived, but
who stood near, told me, he was sure <i>as
how</i> it was either the <i>Duchess</i> of <i>Kingston</i>
or <i>Mrs Rudd</i>, for that he <i>seed</i> her very
plain. I was much surprized at finding an
Englishman so near me; and the singularity
of the man's observation had a very
forcible effect upon me. When the
mirth which it unavoidably occasioned,
was a little subsided, I could not help correcting,
in gentle terms, (though I was otherwise
glad to see even an English footman
so far from <i>English land</i>) a man in his
station for speaking of people of high
rank with so much indecent levity, and
then told him, that there was no such person
living as the <i>Duchess</i> of <i>Kingston</i>, but
that it was probable the Lady he thought
he had seen might be <i>Lady Bristol</i>; that
there was not however, the least resemblance
between the person of her Ladyship
and the other Lady he had mentioned,
the latter being young, thin, and rather
handsome; whereas <i>Lady Bristol</i> was
very fat, and advanced in years; I therefore
suspected, I told him, that he had
confounded the trials of those two Ladies,
and fancied he saw a likeness in their persons,
by an association of ideas; but in reality,
there was as much difference in their
crimes as in their persons. <i>Crimes</i>! did I
say? that is an improper expression, because
I am informed <i>Mrs. Rudd</i> has been acquitted;
but that, if the foreign papers might
be relied on, <i>Lady Bristol</i> had been found
guilty of <span class="smcap">Bigamy</span>: But as he seemed not
to understand what I meant by <i>Bigamy</i>, or
the <i>association of ideas</i>, I was unavoidably
led into a conversation, and explanation,
with this young man; which nothing but
my pride, and his ignorance, could justify;
but as the fellow was overjoyed to see me, I
could not help giving him something to
drink, and with it a caution never to speak
of people of high rank and condition, even
behind their backs, but under their
proper names or titles, and with decency
and respect: he then begged my pardon,
and assured me, if he had known that either
of the Ladies had been a friend of
mine, he would not have coupled them so
improperly together; and I am thoroughly
convinced, the man left me with a resolution,
never to hazard a conjecture without
a better foundation than that he started to
me, and which I rather believe he hit off <i>extempore</i>,
to speak to me, and shew himself
my countryman, than from really suspecting
that the woman behind the curtain
was either <i>Lady Bristol</i>, or <i>Mrs. Rudd</i>;
though I was inclined to think it very probable,
for I had seen <i>Lord Bristol</i> on his
way through <i>Lyons</i> from <i>Italy</i> to <i>England</i>,
and had been informed, <i>Lady Bristol</i> was
then on her road to <i>Italy</i>; in which case,
I, like the footman, had my conjectures,
and accounted for the leather curtains being
so <i>closely buckled to</i>.</p>

<p>These are trifling remarks, you will say;
but if a sign-painter can paint only a bear,
those who employ him must have a bear for
their sign; nevertheless, we have all a certain
curiosity to know even the most trifling
actions, or movements of people, who
by their virtues or vices, especially if they
are people of rank or condition, have occasioned
much talk in the world; and
therefore, ridiculous as this incident is,
yet as we have long known one of the Ladies,
and often <i>admired</i> both, I could not
let either one or the other pass me unnoticed,
on a road too, where even an English
Duchess (if she would own the truth)
would feel a secret delight in meeting of a
Hyde-park-corner groom.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned what partiality
and degree of notice, countrymen take of
each other when they meet far from home.
That notice is always in proportion to the
distance. Had my <i>Bonne</i> footman spoke
of <i>Lady Bristol</i>, or <i>Mrs. Rudd</i>, in such free
terms as <i>how he seed 'em</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. at Hyde-park-corner,
or in Tyburn-road, I should
have knocked him down with the but end
of my whip; but at <i>Bonne</i> (five hundred
miles from either of those places) he and I
were <i>quatre cousins</i>; and I could not help
treating him with a bottle of <i>vin de pais</i>.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_L" id="LETTER_L"></a>LETTER L.</h2>


<p>From <i>Bonne</i> we intended to have taken
the high road to <i>Dijon</i>; but being informed
that there was another, though not
much frequented, by way of <i>Autun</i>, and
that <i>that</i> town, which was a Roman colony,
still contained many curious monuments
worthy of notice, we pursued the
latter, which twisted in between a vast
variety of small, but fertile valleys, watered
with brooks, bounded by romantic
hills, and some high mountains, most of
which were covered with vines, which
<i>did</i> produce the most delicious red wine in
the world; I say <i>did produce</i>, for the high
<i>gout</i> and flavour of the Burgundy grape
has for many years failed, and perhaps so
as never to return again. We, however,
missed the road to <i>Autun</i>, and, after four
leagues' journey through a most delightful
country, we arrived at a miserable auberge
in a dirty village called <i>Yozy</i>, which stands
upon the margin of a large forest, in which,
some years since, the <i>diligence</i> from <i>Lyons</i>
to <i>Paris</i> was attacked by a banditti, and
the whole party of travellers were murdered:
ever since that fatal day, a guard
of the <i>Marechaussee</i> always escort the <i>diligence</i>
through this deep and dreadful forest,
(so they called it), and we were persuaded
it was right to take a couple of the
<i>Marechaussee</i>, and did so; but as we found
the forest by no means so long, deep, or
dreadful, as it had been represented, we
suspected that the advice given us, was
more for the sake of the men who <i>guarded
us</i>, than from any regard <i>to us</i>, two men
could have made no great resistance against
a banditti; and a single man would hardly
have meddled with us.</p>

<p>The next day we passed thro' <i>Arnay-le-Duc</i>,
a pretty country village, three leagues
from <i>Yozy</i>, and it being their annual fair-day,
we had an opportunity of seeing all
the peasantry, dressed in their best, and
much chearfulness, not only in the town,
but upon the road before we arrived, and
after we passed it. Amongst the rest of
the company, were a bear and a monkey,
or rather what <i>Buffon</i> calls the <i>maggot</i>. I
desired the shew-man to permit my <i>maggot</i>,
as he was the least, the youngest, and
the <i>stranger</i>, to pay a visit to <i>Mons. Maggot</i>,
the elder, who embraced the <i>young gentleman</i>
in a manner which astonished and
delighted every body, myself only excepted;
but as <i>my young gentleman</i> seemed totally
indifferent about the <i>old one</i>, I suspected
he had <i>really met his father</i>, and I
could not help moralizing a little.</p>

<p>From <i>Arnay-le-Duc</i> we passed through
<i>Maupas</i>, <i>Salou</i>, <i>Rouvray</i>, <i>Quisse la forge</i>,
and <i>Vermanton</i> to <i>Auxerre</i>, the town where
the French nobleman <i>was said</i> to live,
whom Dr. <i>Smollett</i> treated so very roughly,
and who, in return, was so <i>polite</i> as to
<i>help to tie</i> the Doctor's baggage behind
his coach!</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile without this
town, stands a royal convent, richly endowed,
and delightfully situated; the walls
of which take in near twenty acres of land,
well planted on the banks of a river; and
here I left my two daughters, to perfect
themselves in the French language, as
there was not one person within the convent,
nor that I could find, within the
town, who could speak a word of English.
And here I must not omit to tell you, how
much I was overcome with the generosity
of this virtuous, and I must add amiable,
society of <i>religieux</i>. Upon my first inquiry
about their price for board, lodging, washing,
cloaths, and in short, every thing the
children did, or might want, they required
a sum much beyond the limits of my scanty
income to give; but before we left them,
they became acquainted with <i>some circumstances</i>,
which induced them to express
their concern that the price I had offered
(not half what they had demanded) could
not be taken. We therefore retired, and
had almost fixed the children in a cheaper
convent, but much inferior in all respects,
within the town, when we received a polite
letter from the Lady Abbess, to say,
that after consulting with her sister-hood,
they had come to a resolution to take the
children at our <i>own</i> price, rather than not
shew how much they wished to oblige us.
Upon this occasion, we were <i>all</i> admitted
within the walls of the convent; and I had
the pleasure of seeing my two daughters
joined to an elegant troop of about forty
genteel children, and of leaving them under
the care of the same number of <i>religieux</i>.
And yet these good people knew nothing
of us, but what we ourselves communicated
to them, not being known, nor knowing
any person in the town.&mdash;The Lady-Abbess
of this convent is a woman of high
rank, about twenty-four years of age, and
possesses as large a share of beauty as any
reasonable woman, even on the <i>outside</i> of
a convent, could wish for.</p>

<p><i>Auxerre</i> is a good town, pleasantly situated,
and in a plentiful and cheap country.</p>

<p>From <i>Auxerre</i> to <i>Ioigni</i> is five leagues.
The <i>Petit bel Vue</i> on the banks of the river
is very pleasantly situated, but a dreadful
one within side, in every respect, being a
mixture of dirt, ignorance, and imposition;
but it is the only inn for travellers, and
therefore travellers should avoid it. In order
to put my old hostess in good humour,
I called early for a bottle of Champaigne;
and in order to put me into a bad humour,
she charged me the next day for two; but
I <i>charged her</i> with <i>Mons. Le Connetable</i>,
who behaved like a gentleman, though I
think he was only a <i>marchand de tonneau</i>:
but then he was a <i>wine</i> not <i>beer</i>
cooper, who hooped the old Lady's barrel.</p>

<p>Where-ever I was ill-used or imposed
upon, I always sent a pretty heavy packet
by the post, after I had run down a hundred
miles or two, by way of <i>draw-back</i>,
upon my host, and recompence to the
King's high road; for in France,</p>

</div></div>

<p>An old witch, who had half starved us
at <i>Montpellier</i>, for want of provisions, when
we went, and for want of fire to dry us,
when we came back, left a piece of candle
in my budget, which I did not omit to return
by the post, <i>well packed up</i>, lest it
should grease other packets of more importance,
by riding an hundred leagues;
besides this it was accompanied by a very
civil <i>letter of advice</i>, under another cover.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_LI" id="LETTER_LI"></a>LETTER LI.</h2>


<p>The next town of any note is <i>Sens</i>, a
large, <i>ragged</i>, ancient city; but adorned
with a most noble Gothic cathedral, more
magnificent than even that of <i>Rheims</i>, and
well worthy of the notice of strangers; it
is said to have been built by the English:
With the relicks and <i>custodiums</i> of the host,
are shewn the sacerdotal habits, in which
Archbishop <i>Becket</i> (who resided there many
years) said mass, for it was his head-quarters,
when he <i>left</i> Britain, as well as <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>'s before he went there. The
silver hasps, and some of the ornaments
of these garments, are still perfect, though
it has undergone so many darnings, as to
be little else.</p>

<p><i>Becket</i> was a very tall man; for though
it has many tucks in it, yet it is generally
too long for the tallest priest in the town,
who constantly says mass in it on <i>St. Thomas</i>'s
day.</p>

<p>How times and men are changed! This
town, which resisted the arms of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>
for a considerable time, was put in the utmost
consternation by <i>Dr. Smollett</i>'s causing
his travelling blunderbuss to be only
fired in the air, a circumstance "which
greatly terrified all the <i>petit monde!</i>" It
is very singular, that the Doctor should
have frightened a French nobleman of
<i>Burgundy</i>, by shaking his cane at him,
and even made him assist in the most servile
offices; and in the next town, terrify
all the common people, by only firing a
blunderbuss in the air!</p>

<p>I would not willingly arraign a dead man
with telling two fibbs so close upon the
back of each other; but I am sure there
was but that single French nobleman, in
this mighty kingdom, who would have
submitted to such insults as the Doctor
<i>says</i> he treated him with; nor any other
town but <i>Sens</i>, where the firing of a gun
would have so terrified the inhabitants;
for, drums, guns, and noise of every sort,
seem to afford the common French people
infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>I spent in this town a day or two, and
part of that time with a very agreeable
Scotch family, of the name of <i>Macdonald</i>,
where Lieutenant Colonel <i>Stuart</i> was then
upon a visit.</p>

<p>I have some reason to think that <i>Sens</i> is a
very cheap town. Several English, Scotch,
and Irish families reside in it.</p>

<p>From <i>Sens</i> to <i>Port sur Yonne</i> is three
leagues, and from <i>Yonne</i> to <i>Foussart</i> the
same distance.</p>

<p>At the three Kings at <i>Foussart</i>, suspecting
there was a cat behind the bed in wait for
my bird, I found, instead thereof, a little
<i>narrow door</i>, which was artfully hid, and
which opened into another room; and as
I am sure the man is a cheat, I suspect too,
that upon a <i>good occasion</i>, he would have
made some <i>use</i> of his little door.</p>

<p><i>Foussart</i> is a small place, consisting only
of three or four public houses. From
thence to <i>Morret</i>, is three leagues, on
which road is erected a noble pillar of oriental
marble, in memory of the marriage
of <i>Lewis</i> the XVth. Soon after we passed
this monument, we entered into the delightful
forest of <i>Fontainbleau</i>; and passing
three leagues to the center of it, we arrived
at that ancient royal palace: it stands
very low, and is surrounded by a great
many fine pieces of water, which, however,
render the apartments very damp.
The King and royal family had been there
six weeks, and were gone but ten days, and
with them, all the furniture of the palace
was also gone, except glasses, and a few
pictures, of no great value. In a long, gallery
are placed, on each side of the wall, a
great number of stags' heads, carved in
wood, and upon them are fixed the horns
of stags and bucks, killed by the late, and
former Kings; some of which are very
<i>outre</i>, others singularly large and beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Fontainbleau</i> is a good town, stands adjacent
to the palace; and as the gardens, park,
&amp;c. are always open, it is a delightful summer
residence. We staid a few days there,
to enjoy the shady walks, and to see the humours
of a great annual fair, which commenced
the day after we arrived. All sorts
of things are sold at this fair; but the principal
business is done in the <i>wine way</i>, many
thousand pieces of the inferior Burgundy
wine being brought to this market.</p>

<p>We made two little days' journey from
<i>Fontainbleau</i> to <i>Paris</i>, a town I entered
with concern, and shall leave with pleasure.&mdash;As
I had formerly been of some service
to <i>Faucaut</i> who keeps the <i>Hotel d'York</i>,
when he lived in <i>Rue de Mauvais Gar&ccedil;on</i>
I went to this <i>famous Hotel</i>, which would
have been more in character, if he had
given it the name of his former street,
and called it, <i>L'Hotel de Mauvais Gar&ccedil;on</i> for
it is an hospital of bugs and vermin: the
fellow has got the second-hand beds of
<i>Madame Pompadour</i>, upon his first floor,
which he <i>modestly</i> asks thirty <i>louis d'ors</i> a
month for! All the rest of the apartments
are pigeon-holes, filled with fleas, bugs,
and dirt; and should a fire happen, there
is no way of escaping. Nothing should
be more particularly attended to in <i>Paris</i>
than the security from fire, where so many,
and such a variety of strangers, and
their servants, are shut up at night, within
one <i>Porte Cochere</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">I found no greater alteration in <i>Paris</i>,
after ten years' absence from it, than the
prodigious difference of expence; most
articles, I think, are one-third dearer, and
many double; a horse is not half so well fed
or lodged at <i>Paris</i> as at <i>London</i>; but the
expence is nearly a guinea a week, and a

before he can lodge himself and his horses
under the same roof.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">F</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">F</span></a> <i>Paul Gilladeau</i> who lately left the Silver Lion,
at <i>Calais</i>, has, I am informed, opened a Livery Stable
at <i>Paris</i>, upon the <i>London</i> plan, in partnership
with <i>Dessein</i>, of the <i>Hotel d'Angleterre</i> at <i>Calais</i>: a
convenience much wanted, and undertaken by a
man very likely to succeed.</p></div></div>

<p>The beauties, the pleasures, and variety
of amusements, which this city abounds
with, are, without doubt, the magnets
which attract so many people of rank and
fortune of all nations to it; all which are
too well known to be pointed out by me.&mdash;To
a person of great fortune in the <i>hey-day</i>
of life, <i>Paris</i> may be preferable even
to <i>London</i>; but to one of my age and walk
in life, it is, and was ten years ago, the least
agreeable place I have seen in France.&mdash;Walking
the streets is extremely dangerous,
riding in them very expensive; and
when those things which are worthy to be
seen, (and much there is very worthy) have
been seen, the city of <i>Paris</i> becomes a melancholy
residence for a stranger, who neither
plays at cards, dice, or deals in the principal
manufacture of the city; i.e. <i>ready-made
love</i>, a business which is carried on
with great success, and with more decency,
I think, <ins class="correction" title="This should read 'than'">that</ins> even in <i>London</i>. The
English Ladies are <i>weak</i> enough to attach
themselves to, and to love, one man. The
gay part of the French women love none,
but receive all, <i>pour passer le tems</i>.&mdash;The
<i>English</i>, unlike the <i>Parisian</i> Ladies, take
pains to discover <i>who</i> they love; the French
women to dissemble with those they hate.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult for even strangers
of rank or fortune, to get among the first
people, so as to be admitted to their suppers;
and without that, it is impossible to
have any idea of the luxury and stile in
which they live: quantity, variety, and
show, are more attended to in France,
than neatness. It is in England alone,
where tables are served with real and uniform
elegance; but the appetite meets with
more provocatives in France; and the
French <i>cuisine</i> in that respect, certainly has
the superiority.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I had the honour to be
admitted often to the table of a Lady of the
first rank. On <i>St. Ann's-day</i>, (that being
her name-day) she received the visits of
her friends, who all brought either a valuable
present, a poesy, or a compliment in
verse: when the dessert came upon the table,
which was very magnificent, the middle
plate seemed to be the finest and fairest
fruit (<i>peaches</i>) and I was much surprized,
that none of the Ladies, were helped
by the gentlemen from <i>that</i> plate: but
my surprize was soon turned into astonishment!
for the peaches suddenly burst
forth, and played up the Saint's name, (<i>St.
Ann</i>) in artificial fire-works! and many
pretty devices of the same kind, were
whirled off, from behind the coaches of
her visitors, to which they were fixed, as
the company left the house, which had a
pretty effect, and was no indelicate way
of <i>taking a French leave</i>.</p>

<p>There is certainly among the French
people of fashion an ease and good-breeding,
which is very captivating, and not easily
obtained, but by being bred up with
them, from an early age; the whole body
must be formed for it, as in dancing, while
there is the pliability of youth; and where
there is, as in France, a constant, early,
and intimate correspondence between the
two sexes. Men would be fierce and savage,
were it not for the society of the other
sex, as may be seen among the Turks
and Moors, who must not visit their own
wives, when other men's wives are with
them. In France, the Lady's bed-chamber
is always open, and she receives visits
in bed, or up, with perfect ease. A noble
Lord, late ambassador to this country,
told me, that when he visited a young and
beautiful woman of fashion, (I think too
it was a first visit after marriage) she received
him sitting up in her bed; and before
he went, her <i>fille de chambre</i> brought
his Lordship <i>Madame le Comtesse</i>'s shift elegantly
festooned, which his Lordship had
the honour to put over the Lady's head,
as she sat in bed!&mdash;nor was there, by that
favour, the least indecency meant; it was
a compliment intended; and, as such only,
received. Marks of favour of <i>that</i> sort,
are not marks of <i>further favours</i> from a
French Lady.</p>

<p>In this vast city of amusements, among
the <i>other arts</i>, I cannot help pointing out
to your particular notice, <i>Richlieu</i>'s monument
in the <i>Sorbonne</i>, as an inimitable
piece of modern sculpture<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">G</a> by <i>Girardeau</i>;
and <i>Madame la Valliere's</i> full-length
portrait by <i>le Brun</i>: She was, you know,
mistress to <i>Lewis</i> the XIVth, but retired
to the convent, in which the picture now
is, and where she lived in repentance and
sorrow above thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">H</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">G</span></a> <span class="smcap">Voltaire</span> says, this monument is not sufficiently
noticed by strangers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">H</span></a> <span class="smcap">Madame Valliere</span>, during her retirement,
being told of the death of one of her sons, replied,
"I should rather grieve for his birth, than his
death."</p></div></div>

<p>The <i>connoisseurs</i> surely can find no reasonable
fault with the monumental artist;
but they do, I think, with <i>le Brun</i>; the
drapery, they say, is too full, and that she
is overcharged with garments; but fulness
of dress, adds not only dignity, but decency,
to the person of a fine woman, who
meant (or the painter for her) to hide,
not to expose her charms.</p>

<p>If fulness be a fault, it is a fault that
<i>Gainsborough</i>, <i>Hoare</i>, <i>Pine</i>, <i>Reynolds</i>, and
many other of our modern geniuses are
<i>guilty of</i>; and if it be <i>sin</i>, the best judges
will acquit them for committing it, where
dignity is to be considered.</p>

<p><i>Madame Valliere</i> appears to have been
scattering about her jewels, is tearing her
hair, crying, and looking up to the heavens,
which seem bursting forth a tempest
over her head. The picture is well imagined,
and finely executed.</p>

<p>I found upon the bulk of a <i>portable shop</i>
in <i>Paris</i>, a most excellent engraving from
this picture,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">I</a> and which carried me directly
to visit the original; it is indeed
stained and dirty, but it is infinitely superior
to a later engraving which now hangs
up in all the print shops, and I suppose is
from the first plate, which was done soon
after the picture was finished. Under it
are written the following ingenious, tho'
I fear, rather impious lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Magdala dam gemmas, baccisque monile coruscum</div>
<div class="i1">Projicit, ac form&aelig; detrahit arma su&aelig;:</div>

</div>
<p>Shall I attempt to unfold this writer's
meaning? Yes, I will, that my friend at
<i>Oxford</i> may laugh, and do it as it ought to
be done.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<h4>I.</h4>
<div class="i0">The pearls and gems, her beauty's arms,</div>

<div class="i1">Superior still to those.</div>

<div class="i0">The tears that flow adown her cheek,</div>

<div class="i0">For these an earthly Monarch seek,</div>
<div class="i1">But those the <span class="smcap">King</span> of Kings.</div>
</div></div>

<p>This seems to have been the author's
thought, if he thought <i>chastely</i>.&mdash;Shall I
try again?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The pearls and gems her beauty's arms,</div>
<div class="i1">See sad <span class="smcap">Valliere</span> foregoes:</div>
<div class="i0">Yet still those tears have other charms,</div>

<div class="i0">With those she gained an earthly Monarch's love:</div>
<div class="i0">With these she wins the <span class="smcap">King</span> of Kings above.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yet, after all, I do suspect, that the author
meant more than even <i>to sneer</i> a little
at <i>poor Madam Valliere</i>; but, as I dislike
common-place poetry, (and poetry, as
you see, dislikes <i>me</i>) I will endeavour to
give you the literal meaning, according to
my conception, and then you will see
whether our <i>joint wits</i> jump together.</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Magdalene</span> throws by her bracelets, adorned
with gems and pearls, and (thus) disarms her
beauty: while tears confound her countenance and

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">With wonder mark the stratagems of love,</div>
<div class="i0">With this she captivates the <span class="smcap">God</span> above.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The impious insinuation of the Latin
lines, is the reason, I suppose, why they
were omitted under the more modern impression
of this fine print, and very middling
French poetry superseding them.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_LIII" id="LETTER_LIII"></a>LETTER LIII.</h2>


<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Paris.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">If you do not use <i>Herreis</i>' bills, I recommend
to you at <i>Paris</i>, a French, rather
than an English banker; I have found the
former more profitable, and most convenient.
I had, ten years since, a letter of
credit on <i>Sir John Lambert</i>, for &pound;300,
from <i>Mess. Hoares</i>. The <i>Knight</i> thought
proper, however, to refuse the payment of
a twenty pound draft I gave upon him;
though I had not drawn more than half
my credit out of his hands. <i>Mons. Mary</i>,
on whom I had a draft from the same respectable
house, this year will not do <i>such
things</i>; but on the contrary, be ready to
serve and oblige strangers to the utmost
of his power: he speaks and writes English
very well, and will prove an agreeable and
useful acquaintance to a stranger in <i>Paris</i>.
His sister too, who lives with him, will be
no less so to the female part of your family.
His house is in <i>Rue Saint Sauveur</i>.</p>

<p>The English bankers pay in silver, and
it is necessary to take a wheel-barrow with
you to bring it away; a small bag will do
at the French bankers'.</p>

<p>There is as much difference between the
bankers of <i>London</i> and bankers in <i>Paris</i>,
as between a rotten apple and a sound one.
You can hardly get a word from a London
banker, but you are sure of getting your
money; in <i>Paris</i>, you will get <i>words</i>
enough, and civil ones too. Remember,
however, I am speaking only of the treatment
I have experienced. There may be,
and are, no doubt, English bankers at <i>Paris</i>
of great worth, and respectable characters.</p>

<p>It is not reckoned very decent to frequent
coffee-houses at <i>Paris</i>; but the politeness
of <i>Monsieur</i> and <i>Madame Felix, au caffe de
Conti</i>, opposite the <i>Pont neuf</i>, and the English
news-papers, render their house a
pleasant circumstance to me; and it is by
much the best, and best situated, of any in
<i>Paris, au vois le monde</i>.</p>

<p>I am astonished, that where such an infinite
number of people live in so small a
compass, (for <i>Paris</i> is by no means so large
as <i>London</i>) that they should suffer the
dead to be buried in the manner they do,
or within the city. There are several burial
pits in <i>Paris</i>, of a prodigious size and
depth, in which the dead bodies are laid,
side by side, without any earth being put
over them till the ground tier is full; then,
and not till then, a small layer of earth covers
them, and another layer of dead
comes on, till by layer upon layer, and
dead upon dead, the hole is filled with a
mass of human corruption, enough to
breed a plague; these places are enclosed,
it is true, within high walls; but nevertheless,
the air cannot be <i>improved</i> by it; and
the idea of such an assemblage of putrifying
bodies, in one grave, so thinly covered,
is very disagreeable. The burials in
churches too, often prove fatal to the priests
and people who attend; but every body,
and every thing in <i>Paris</i>, is so much alive,
that not a soul thinks about the dead.</p>

<p>I wish I had been born a Frenchman.&mdash;Frenchmen
live as if they were never to
die. Englishmen die all <i>their lives</i>; and
yet as <i>Lewis</i> the XIVth said, "I don't
think it is so difficult a matter to die, as
men generally imagine, when they
try in earnest."</p>

<p>I must tell you before I leave <i>Paris</i>, that
I stept over to <i>Marli</i>, to see the Queen; I
had seen the King nine years ago; but he
was not then a King over eight millions
of people, and the finest country under the
sun; yet he does not seem to lay so much
stress upon his mighty power as might be
expected from so young a prince, but appears
grave and thoughtful. I am told he
attends much to business, and endeavours
to make his subjects happy. His resolution
to be inoculated, immediately after
succeeding to such a kingdom, is a proof
of his having a great share of fortitude.
In England such a determination would
have been looked upon with indifference;
but in France, where the bulk of the people
do not believe that it secures the patient
from a second attack; where the clergy
in general consider it unfavourable, even
in a religious light; and where the
physical people, for want of practice,
do not understand the management of the
distemper, so as it is known in England;
I may venture to say, without being charged
with flattery, that it was an heroic resolution:
add to this, the King knowing, that
if his subjects followed his example, it
must be chiefly done by their own surgeons
and physicians, he put himself
under their management alone, though I
think <i>Sutton</i> was then at <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>The Queen is a fine figure, handsome,
and very sprightly, dresses in the present
<i>gout</i> of head dress, and without a handkerchief,
and thereby displays a most lovely
neck.</p>

<p>I saw in a china shop at <i>Paris</i>, the figure
of the King and Queen finely executed,
and very like, in china: the King is playing
on the harp, and the Queen dropping
her work to listen to the harmony. The
two figures, about a foot high, were placed
in an elegant apartment, and the <i>toute ensemble</i>
was the prettiest toy I ever beheld:
the price thirty guineas.</p>

<p>I shall leave this town in a few days, and
take the well-known and well-beaten <i>route
Anglois</i> for <i>Calais</i>, thro' <i>Chantilly</i>, <i>Amiens</i>,
and <i>Boulogne</i>, and then I shall have twice
crossed this mighty kingdom.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="LETTER_LIV" id="LETTER_LIV"></a>LETTER LIV.</h2>


<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Calais.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">I am now returned to the point from
whence I sat out, and rather within the
revolution of one year; which, upon the
whole, though I met with many untoward
circumstances, has been the most interesting
and entertaining year of my whole
life, and will afford me matter of reflection
for the little which remains unfinished of
that journey we must all take sooner or
later, a journey from whence no traveller
returns.&mdash;And having said so much of myself,
I am sure you will be glad to change
the subject from man to beast, especially to
such a one as I have now to speak of.</p>

<p>I told you, when I set out, that I had
bought a handsome-looking English horse
for seven guineas, but a little touched in his
wind; I can now inform you, that when I
left this town, he was rather thin, and had
a sore back and shoulder; both which, by
care and caution; were soon healed, and
that he is returned fair and fat, and not a
hair out of its place, though he drew two
grown persons, two children, (one of thirteen
the other ten years old) a very heavy
French cabriolet, and all our baggage, nay,
almost all my goods, chattels, and worldly
property whatever, outward and homeward,
except between <i>Cette</i> and <i>Barcelona</i>,
<i>going</i>, and <i>Lyons</i> and this town <i>returning!</i>
I will point out to you one of his day's
work, by which you will be able to judge
of his general power of working: At <i>Perpignan</i>,
I had, to save him, hired post-horses
to the first town in Spain, as I thought it
might be too much for him to ascend and
descend the <i>Pyrenees</i> in one day; beside
sixteen miles to the foot of them, on this
side, and three to <i>Jonquire</i> on the other;
but after the horses were put to, the post-master
required me to take two men to
<i>Boulou</i>, in order to hold the chaise, and to
prevent its overturning in crossing the river
near the village. Such a flagrant attempt
to impose, determined me to take
neither horses nor men; and at seven
o'clock I set off with <i>Callee</i> (that is my
houyhnhnm's name) and arrived in three
hours at <i>Boulou</i>, a paltry village, but in a
situation fit for the palace of <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>!</p>

<p>So far from wanting men from <i>Perpignan</i>
to conduct my chaise over the river,
the whole village were, upon our arrival,
in motion after the <span class="smcap">job</span>. We, however,
passed it, without any assistance but our
own weight to keep the wheels down, and
the horse's strength and sturdiness, to drag
us through it. In about three hours more
we passed over the summit of this great
chain of the universe; and in two more,
arrived at <i>Jonquire</i>: near which village my
horse had a little bait of fresh mown hay,
the first, and last, he eat in that kingdom.
And when I tell you that this faithful, and
(for a great part of my journey) only servant
I had, never made a <i>faux pas</i>, never
was so tired, but that upon a pinch, he
could have gone a league or two farther;
nor ever was ill, lame, physicked, or bled,
since he was mine; you will agree, that
either he is an uncommon good horse, or
that his master is a good groom! Indeed I
will say that, however fatigued, wet, <ins class="correction" title="Should be 'hungry'?">hundry</ins>,
or droughty I was, I never partook
of any refreshment till my horse had every
comfort the inn could afford. I carried a
wooden bowl to give him water, and never
passed a brook without asking him to
drink.&mdash;And, as he has been my faithful
servant, I am now his; for he lives under
the same roof with me, and does nothing
but eat, drink, and sleep.&mdash;As he never
sees me nor hears my voice, without taking
some affectionate notice of me, I ventured
to ask him <i>tenderly</i>, whether he
thought he should be able to draw two of
the same party next year to <i>Rome?</i> No
tongue could more plainly express his willingness!
he answered me, <i>in French</i>, indeed,
<i>we-we-we-we-we</i>, said he; so perhaps
he might not be sincere, tho' he never
yet deceived me. If, however, he
should not go, or should out-live me,
which, is very probable, my dying request
to you will be, to procure him a peaceful
walk for the remainder of his days, within
the park-walls of some humane private
gentleman; though I flatter myself the following
petition will save <i>you</i> that trouble,
and <i>me</i> the concern of leaving him without
that comfort which his faithful services
merit.</p>

<p>I do hereby certify, that nothing is advanced
in the above petition, but what is
strictly true, and that if the petitioner had
been able to express himself properly, his
merits and good qualities would have appeared
to much greater advantage, as well
as his services; as he has omitted many
towns he attended his master to, besides a
variety of smaller journies; that he is cautious,
wary, spirited, diligent, faithful, and
honest; that he is not nice, but eats, with
appetite, and good temper, whatever is set
before him; and that he is in all respects
worthy of that asylum he asks, and which
his master laments more on his account
than his own, that he cannot give him.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Calais</span>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">On our way here, we spent two or three
days at <i>Chantilly</i>, one, of fifty <i>Chatteaus</i>
belonging to the <span class="smcap">Prince of Conde</span>: for,
though we had visited this delightful place,
two or three times, some years ago, yet,
beside its natural beauties, there is always
something new. One spot we found particularly
pleasing, nay flattering to an Englishman;
it is called <i>l'Isle d'Amour</i>, in which
there are some thatched cottages, a water-mill,
a garden, shrubbery, &amp;c. in the English
taste, and the whole is, in every respect,
well executed. The dairy is neat,
and the milkmaid not ugly, who has her
little villa, as well as the miller. There is
also a tea-house, a billiard-room, an eating-room,
and some other little buildings,
all externally in the English village stile,
which give the lawn, and serpentine walks
that surround them, a very pastoral appearance.
The eating-room is particularly
well fancied, being covered within,
and so painted as to produce a good idea
of a close arbor; the several windows,
which are pierced through the sides, have
such forms, as the fantastic turn of the bodies
of the painted trees admit of; and the
building is in a manner surrounded with
natural trees; the room, when illuminated
for the Prince's supper, has not only a very
pleasing effect, but is a well executed
deception, for the real trees falling into
perspective with those which are painted,
through the variety of odd-shaped windows,
has a very natural, and consequently
a very pleasing effect; but what adds
greatly to the deception, is, that at each
corner of the room the floor is opened,
and lumps of earth thrown up, which bear,
in full perfection, a great variety of flowers
and flowering shrubs. We had the honour
to be admitted while the Prince of
<i>Conde</i>, the Duke and Duchess of <i>Bourbon</i>,
the Princess of <i>Monaco</i>, and two or three
other ladies and gentlemen were at supper;
a circumstance which became rather
painful to us, as it seemed to occasion some
to the company, and particularly to the
Prince, who inquired who we were, and
took pains to shew every sort of politeness
he could to strangers he knew nothing of.
The supper was elegantly served on plate;
but there seemed to me too many servants
round the table. The conversation was
very little, and very reserved. I do not
recollect that I saw scarce a smile during
the whole time of supper.</p>

<p>The Prince is a sprightly, agreeable
man, something in person like <i>Lord Barrington</i>;
and the <i>Duke</i> of <i>Bourbon</i> so like
his father, that it was difficult to know the
son from the father.</p>

<p>The <i>Duchess</i> of <i>Bourbon</i> is young, handsome,
and a most accomplished lady.</p>

<p>During the supper, a good band of music
played; but it was all wind instruments.
Mr. <i>Lejeune</i>, the first bassoon, is a
most capital performer indeed.</p>

<p>After the dessert had been served up about
ten minutes, the Princess of <i>Monaco</i>
rose from the table, as did all the company,
and suddenly turning from it, each
lady and gentleman's servant held them a
water glass, which they used with great
delicacy, and then retired.</p>

<p>The Princess of <i>Monaco</i> is separated from
the Prince her husband; yet she has beauty
enough for any Prince in Europe, and
brought fortune enough for two or three.</p>

<p>The Duchess of <i>Bourbon</i> had rather a
low head-dress, and without any feather,
or, that I could perceive, <i>rouge</i>; the Princess
of <i>Monaco's</i> head-dress was equally
plain; the two other ladies, whose rank I
do not recollect, wore black caps, and hats
high dressed. There were eight persons
sat down to table, and I think, about
twenty-five servants, in and out of livery,
attended.</p>

<p>The next day, we were admitted to see
the Prince's cabinet of natural and artificial
curiosities; and as I intimated my design
of publishing some account of my journey,
the Prince was pleased to allow me as much
time as I chose, to examine his very large
and valuable collection; among which is a
case of gold medallions,(72) of the Kings
of France, in succession, a great variety of
birds and beasts, ores, minerals, petrifactions,
gems, cameos, &amp;c. There is also a
curious cabinet, lately presented to the
Prince by the King of Denmark; and near
it stood a most striking representation, in
wax, of a present said to be <i>served up</i> to a
late unfortunate Queen; it is the head and
right hand of <i>Count Struensee</i>, as they were
taken off after the execution; the head and
hand lie upon a silver dish, with the blood
and blood vessels too, well executed; never
surely was any thing so <i>sadly</i>, yet so
finely done. I defy the nicest eye, however
near, to distinguish it (suppose the head
laid upon a pillow in a bed) from nature;
nor must Mrs. <i>Wright</i>, or any of the workers
in wax I have ever yet seen, pretend
to a tythe of the perfection in that art,
with the man who made this head.&mdash;Sad
as the subject is, I could not withstand the
temptation of asking permission to take a
copy of it; and fortunately, I found the
man who made it was then at <i>Paris</i>,&mdash;nor
has he executed his work for me less perfect
than that he made for the Prince.&mdash;I
have been thus particular in mentioning
this piece of art, because, of the kind, I
will venture to say, it is not only <i>deadly</i>
fine, but one of the most perfect deceptions
ever seen.</p>

<p>When you, or any of the ladies and gentlemen
who have honoured this poor performance
of mine with their names, or
their family or friends, pass this way, I
shall be happy to embrace that occasion,
to shew, that I have not said more of this
inimitable piece of art, than it merits; nor
do I speak thus positively from my own
judgment, but have the concurrent opinion
of many men of unquestionable judgment,
that it is a master-piece of art; and
among the rest, our worthy and valuable
friend Mr. <i>Sharp</i>, of the <i>Old Jewry</i>.</p>

<p>Before we left <i>Chantilly</i>, we had a little
concert, to which <i>my train</i> added one performer;
and as it was the only string instrument,
it was no small addition.</p>

<p>The day we left this charming place, we
found the Prince and all his company under
tents and pavilions on the road-side,
from whence they were preparing to follow
the hounds.</p>

<p>At <i>Amiens</i>, there is in the <i>Hotel de Ville</i>,
a little antique god in bronze, which was
found, about four years ago, near a Roman
urn, in the earth, which is very well
worthy of the notice of a <i>connoisseur</i>; but
it is such as cannot decently be described;
the person in whose custody it is, permitted
me to take an impression from it in wax;
but I am not <i>quite so good</i> a hand at waxwork
as the artist mentioned above, and
yet my little houshold-god has some merit,
a merit too that was not discovered till
three months after it had been fixed in the
<i>Hotel de Ville</i>; and the discovery was made
by a female, not a male, <i>connoisseur</i>.</p>

<p>It is said, that a Hottentot cannot be so
civilized, but that he has always a hankering
after his savage friends, and <i>dried chitterlins</i>;
and, that gypsies prefer their roving
life, to any other, a circumstance that
once did, but now no longer surprizes me;
for I feel such a desire to wander again,
that I am impatient till the winter is past,
when I intend to visit <i>Geneva</i>, and make
the tour of Italy; and if you can find me
cut a sensible valetudinarian or two, of either
sex, or any age, who will travel as we
do, to see what is to be seen, to make a little
stay, where <i>the place</i>, or <i>the people</i> invite
us to do so, who can dine on a cold partridge,
in a hot day, under a shady tree;
and travel in a <i>landau and one</i>, we will
keep them a <i>table d'hote</i>, that shall be more
pleasant than expensive, and which will
produce more health and spirits, than half
the drugs of Apothecary's Hall.</p>

<p>If God delights so much in variety, as
all things animate and inanimate sufficiently
prove, no wonder that man should do
so too: and I have now been so accustomed
to move, though slowly, that I intend
to creep on to my <i>journey's end</i>, by which
means I may live to have been an inhabitant
of every town almost in Europe, and
die, as I have lately (and wish I had always)
lived, a free citizen of the whole
world, slave to no sect, nor subject to any
King. Yet, I would not be considered as
one wishing to promote that disposition in
others; for I must confess, that it is in
England alone, where an innocent and
virtuous man can sit down and enjoy the
blessings of liberty and his own chearful
hearth, in full confidence that no earthly
power can disturb it; and the best reason
which can be offered in favour of Englishmen
visiting other kingdoms, is, to enable
them, upon their return, to know how
to enjoy the inestimable blessings of their
own.</p>

<p>For what should I cross the streight
which divides us, though it were but <i>half</i>
seven leagues? we should only meet to part
again, and purchase pleasure, as most pleasures
are purchased, too dearly; I have
dropt some heavy tears, (ideally at least)
over poor <span class="smcap">Buckle's</span><a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">J</a> grave, and it is all
one to a man, now with <span class="smcap">God</span>! on what
King's soil such a <i>tribute as that</i> is paid:
had some men of all nations known the
goodness of his heart as we did, some men
of all nations would grieve as we do.
When I frequented <i>Morgan's</i><a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">K</a> I used him
as a touch-stone, to try the hearts of other
men upon; for, as he was not rich, he was
out of the walk of knaves and flatterers,
and such men, who were moot prejudiced in
his favour at first sight, and coveted not his
company after a little acquaintance, I always
avoided as beings made of base metal.
It was for this reason I despised that
****** ****, (you know who I mean) for
you too have seen him <i>snarl</i>, <i>and bite</i>, <i>and
play the dog</i>, even to <span class="smcap">Buckle</span>!</p>

<p>Our Sunday night's tea club, round his
chearful hearth, is now for ever dissolved,
and <span class="smcap">Sharpe</span> and <span class="smcap">Rye</span> have administered
their last friendly offices with a potion of
sorrow.</p>

<p>Were I the hermit of <i>St. Catharine</i>, I
would chissel his name as deeply into one
of my pine-heads, as his virtues are impressed
on my memory. Though I have
lost <i>his guinea</i>, I will not lose his name; he
looked down with pity upon me when
here; who can say he may not do so still?
I should be an infidel, did not a few such
men as he <i>keep me back</i>.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Sir, after the many
trifling subjects in this very long correspondence
with you, I will avail myself of this
good one, to close it, on the noblest work
of GOD, <span class="smcap">an honest Man</span>. The loss of
such a friend, is sufficient to induce one
to lay aside all pursuits, but that of following
his example, and to prepare to follow
him.</p>

<p>If you should ever follow me <i>here</i>, I
flatter myself you will find, that I have, to
the best of my poor abilities, made such a
sketch of <i>men and things</i> on this side of the
water, that you will be able to discover
some likeness to the originals. A bad
painter often hits the general features,
though he fall ever so short of the graces
of <i>Titian</i>, or the <i>Morbidezza</i> of <i>Guido</i>. I
am sure, therefore, you and every man of
candour, will make allowances for the
many inaccuracies, defects, &amp;c. which I
am sensible these letters abound with, tho'
I am incapable of correcting them. My
journey, you know was not made, as most
travellers' are, to indulge in luxury, or in
pursuit of pleasures, but to soften sorrow,
and to recover from a blow, which came
from a mighty hand indeed; but a <span class="smcap">hand</span>
still <span class="smcap">more mighty</span>, has enabled me to
resist it, and to return in health, spirits,
and with that peace of mind which no
<i>earthly power</i> can despoil me of, and with
that friendship and regard for you, which
will only cease, when I cease to be</p>

<p>P.S. I found <i>Berwick's</i> regiment on
duty in this town: it is commanded by
<i>Mons. le Duc de Fitz-James</i>, and a number
of Irish gentlemen, my countrymen, (for
so I will call them.) You may easily imagine,
that men who possess the natural hospitality
of their own country, with the politeness
and good-breeding of this, must
be very agreeable acquaintance in general:
But I am bound to go farther, and to say,
that I am endeared to them by marks of
true friendship. The King of France, nor
any Prince in Europe, cannot boast of
troops better disciplined; nor is the King
insensible of their merit, for I have lately
seen a letter written by the King's command
from <i>Comte de St. Germain</i>, addressed
to the officers of one of these corps,
whereby it appears, that the King is truly
sensible of their distinguished merit; for
braver men there are not in any service:&mdash;What
an acquisition to France! what a
loss to Britain!</p>

<p>As the <i>Marquis</i> of <i>Grimaldi</i> is retired
from his public character, I am tempted
to send you a specimen of his private one,
which flattering as it is to me, and honourable
to himself, I should have withheld, had
his Excellency continued first
minister of Spain; by which you will see,
that while my own countrymen united to
set me in a suspicious light, (though they
thought otherwise) the ministers politeness
and humanity made them tremble at
the duplicity of their conduct; and had I
been disposed to have acted the same sinister
part they did, some of them might
have been reminded of an old Spanish proverb,</p>

Votre imagination est g&ecirc;n&eacute;e de ne pouvoir se la

<p>Ce d&eacute;but n'est pas fort seduisant; aussi ne vous
ai-je rien promis de merveilleux. Je pourrois
cependant pour embellir ma narration me perdre
dans de brillantes descriptions, et commencer par
celle de notre clocher; mais malheureusement
nous n'en avons point; car je ne crois pas que
l'on puisse appeller de ce nom l'endroit presque
souterrain o&ugrave; logent trois mauvaises cloches.
Elles m'&eacute;tourdissent par fois au point que sans
leur bapt&ecirc;me, je les enverrois aux enfers sonner
les diners de <i>Pluton</i> et de <i>Proserpine</i>.</p>

<p>On apper&ccedil;oit pr&egrave;s de l'Eglise, entre elle et le
cur&eacute;, une petite fen&ecirc;tre grill&eacute;e, ceci est une vraie
curiosit&eacute;; c'est un s&eacute;pulcre b&acirc;ti par <i>Saladin d'Anglure</i>,
ancien Seigneur de <i>Courcelles</i> il vivoit du
tems des croisades, et donna comme les autres
dans la manie du si&eacute;cle. Il ne fut pas plus heureux
que ses confreres. Son sort fut d'&ecirc;tre prisonnier
du vaillant Saladin dont il conserva le
surnom. Sa captivit&eacute; l'ennuyant, il fit v&oelig;u, si
elle finissoit bient&ocirc;t, de b&agrave;tir dans sa Seigneurie
un s&eacute;pulcre, et un calvaire &agrave; m&ecirc;me distance l'un
de l'autre qu'ils le sont &agrave; J&eacute;rusalum. C'est aussi
ce qu'il fit.</p>

<p class="noindent">I should have stopt here, and finished
my present correspondence with you by
leaving your mind harmonized with the
above sweet stanzas of <i>Madame des Jardins</i>,
but that it may seem strange, to give a
specimen of one French Lady's literary
talents, without acknowledging, that this
kingdom abounds with many, of infinite
merit.&mdash;While England can boast only of
about half a dozen women, who will immortalize
their names by their works,
France can produce half an hundred, admired
throughout Europe, for their wit,
genius, and elegant compositions.&mdash;Were
I to recite the names and writings only of
female authors of eminence, which France
has produced, since the time of the first,
and most unfortunate <i>Heloise</i>, who died in
1079, down to <i>Madame Riccoboni</i>, now
living, it would fill a volume. We have,
however, a <span class="smcap">Carter</span>, and a <span class="smcap">Barbauld</span>,
not less celebrated for their learning and
genius than for their private virtues; and
I think it may, with more truth be said of
women, than of men, that the more knowledge,
the more virtue; the more understanding,
the less courage. Why then is
the <i>plume elevated to the head</i>? and what
must the present mode of female education
and manners end in, but in more ignorance,
dissipation, debauchery and luxury?
and, at length, in national ruin. Thus
it was at <span class="smcap">Rome</span>, the mistress of the world;
they became fond of the most vicious men,
and such as meant to enslave them, who
corrupted their hearts, by humouring and
gratifying their follies, and encouraging,
on all sides, idleness and dissolute manners,
blinded by <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>'s complaisance;
from his <i>almsmen</i>, they became his <i>bondmen</i>;
he charmed them in order to enslave
them. When the tragedy of <i>Tereus</i> was
acted at <span class="smcap">Rome</span>, <i>Cicero</i> observed, what plaudits
the audience gave with their hands
at some severe strokes in it against tyranny;
but he very justly lamented, that they
employed their hands, <i>only in the Theatre</i>,
not in defending that liberty which they
seemed so fond of.</p>

a Dance." &mdash;&mdash;</h3>

<p class="center">I.</p>


<p>If you travel post, when you approach
the town, or bourg where you intend to
lie, ask the post-boy, which house he recommends
as the best? and never go to
that, if there is any other.&mdash;Be previously
informed what other inns there are in the
same place. If you go according to the
post-boy's recommendation, the aubergiste
gives him two or three livres, which he
makes you pay the next morning. I know
but one auberge between <i>Marseilles</i> and
<i>Paris</i>, where this is not a constant practice,
and that is at <i>Vermanton</i>, five leagues
from <i>Auxerre</i>, where every English traveller
will find a decent landlord, <i>Monsieur
Brunier</i>, <i>a St. Nicolas</i>; good entertainment,
and no imposition, and consequently
an inn where no post-boy will drive, if he
can avoid it.</p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>If you take your own horses, they must
be provided with head-pieces, and halters;
the French stables never furnish any
such things; and your servant must take
care that the <i>Gar&ccedil;on d'Ecurie</i> does not
buckle them so tight, that the horses cannot
take a full bite, this being a common
practice, to save hay.</p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>If the <i>Gar&ccedil;on d'Ecurie</i> does not bring
the halters properly rolled up, when he
puts your horses to, he ought to have nothing
given him, because they are so constantly
accustomed to do it, that they cannot
forget it, <i>but in hopes you may too</i>.</p>


<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p>Direct your servant, not only to see
your horses watered, and corn given them,
but to <i>stand by</i> while they eat it: this is
often necessary in England, and always in
France.</p>


<p class="center">V.</p>

<p>If you eat at the <i>table d'Hote</i>, the price
is fixed, and you cannot be imposed upon.
If you eat in your own chamber, and order
your own dinner or supper, it is as necessary
to make a previous bargain with
your host for it, as it would be to bargain
with an itinerant Jew for a gold watch;
the <i>conscience</i> and <i>honour</i> of a <i>French Aubergiste</i>,
and a travelling Jew, are always
to be considered alike; and it is very remarkable,
that the publicans in France,
are the only people who receive strangers
with a cool indifference! and where this
indifference is most shewn, there is most
reason to be cautious.</p>


<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p>Be careful that your sheets are well
aired, otherwise you will find them often,
not only damp, but perfectly wet.&mdash;Frenchmen
in general do not consider
wet or damp sheets dangerous, I am sure
French <i>Aubergistes</i> do not.</p>


<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p>Young men who travel into France with
a view of gaining the language, should always
eat at the <i>table d'Hote</i>.&mdash;There is
generally at these tables, an officer, or a
priest, and though there may be none but
people of a middling degree, they will shew
every kind of attention and preference to
a stranger.</p>


<p class="center">VIII.</p>

<p>It is necessary to carry your own pillows
with you; in some inns they have them;
but in villages, <i>bourgs</i>, &amp;c. none are to be
had.</p>


<p class="center">IX.</p>

<p>In the wine provinces, at all the <i>table
d'Hotes</i>, they always provide the common
wine, as we do small beer; wine is never
paid for separately, unless it is of a quality
above the <i>vin du Pays</i>; and when you call
for better, know the price <i>before</i> you
drink it.</p>


<p class="center">X.</p>

<p>When fine cambrick handkerchiefs, &amp;c.
are given to be washed, take care they are
not trimmed round two inches narrower,
to make borders to <i>Madame la Blanchisseuse's</i>
night caps: this is a little <i>douceur</i>
which they think themselves entitled to,
from my Lord <i>Anglois</i>, whom they are sure
is <i>tres riche</i>, and consequently ought to be
plundered by the poor.</p>


<p class="center">XI.</p>

<p>Whenever you want honest information,
get it from a French officer, or a priest,
provided they are on the <i>wrong</i> side of forty;
but in general, avoid all acquaintance
with either, on the <i>right</i> side of thirty.</p>


<p class="center">XII.</p>

<p>Where you propose to stay any time, be
very cautious with whom you make an acquaintance,
as there are always a number
of officious forward Frenchmen, and English
adventurers, ready to offer you their
services, from whom you will find it very
difficult to disengage yourself, after you
have found more agreeable company.&mdash;Frenchmen
of real fashion, are very circumspect,
and will not <i>fall in love with you</i>
at first sight; but a designing knave will
exercise every species of flattery, in order
to fix himself upon you for his dinner, or
what else he can get, and will be with
you before you are up, and after you are
in bed.</p>


<p class="center">XIII.</p>

<p>Wherever there is any cabinet of curiosities,
medals, pictures, &amp;c. to be seen,
never make any scruple to send a card, desiring
permission to view them; the request
is flattering to a Frenchman, and you will
never be refused; and besides this you will
in all probability thereby gain a valuable
acquaintance.&mdash;It is generally men of
sense and philosophy, who make such collections,
and you will find the collector
of them, perhaps, the most pleasing part
of the cabinet.</p>


<p class="center">XIV.</p>

<p>Take it as a maxim, unalterable as the
laws of the Medes and Persians, that whenever
you are invited to a supper at <i>Paris</i>,
<i>Lyons</i>, or any of the great cities, where a
<i>little</i> trifling play commences before supper,
that <span class="smcap">great play</span> is intended after
supper; and that you are the marked pigeon
to be plucked. Always remember
<i>Lord Chesterfield's</i> advice to his son: "If
you play with men, know with <i>whom</i>
you play; if with women, for <i>what</i>:"
and don't think yourself the more secure,
because you see at the same table some of
your own countrymen, though they are
Lords or Ladies; a <i>London</i> gambler would
have no chance in a <i>Parisian</i> party.</p>


<p class="center">XV.</p>

<p>Dress is an essential and most important
consideration with every body in France.
A Frenchman never appears till his hair is
well combed and powdered, however slovenly
he may be in other respects.&mdash;Not
being able to submit every day to this ceremony,
the servant to a gentleman of fashion
at whose house I visited in <i>Marseilles</i>,
having forgot my name described me to
his master, as the gentleman whose hair
was <i>toujours mal frise</i>.&mdash;Dress is a foolish
thing, says <i>Lord Chesterfield</i>; yet it is a
foolish thing not to be well dressed.</p>


<p class="center">XVI.</p>

<p>You cannot dine, or visit after dinner,
in an undress frock, or without a bag to
your hair; the hair <i>en queue</i>, or a little cape
to your coat, would be considered an unpardonable
liberty. Military men have an
advantage above all others in point of dress,
in France; a regimental or military coat
carries a man with a <i>bonne grace</i> into all
companies, with or without a bag to his
hair; it is of all others the properest dress
for a stranger in France, on many accounts.</p>


<p class="center">XVII.</p>

<p>In France it is not customary to drink to
persons at table, nor to drink wine after
dinner: when the dessert is taken away, so
is the wine;&mdash;an excellent custom, and
worthy of being observed by all nations.</p>


<p class="center">XVIII.</p>

<p>It is wrong to be led into any kind of
conversation, but what is absolutely necessary,
with the common, or indeed the
middling class of people in France. They
never fail availing themselves of the least
condescension in a stranger, to ask a number
of impertinent questions, and to conclude,
you answer them civilly, that they
are your equals.&mdash;Sentiment and bashfulness
are not to be met with, but among
people of rank in France: to be free and
easy, is the etiquette of the country; and
some kinds of that free and easy manner,
are highly offensive to strangers, and particularly
to a shy Englishman.</p>


<p class="center">XIX.</p>

<p>When well-bred people flatter strangers,
they seldom direct their flattery to
the object they mean to compliment, but
to one of their own country:&mdash;As, what a
<i>bonne grace</i> the English have, says one to
the other, in a whisper loud enough to be
heard by the whole company, who all give
a nod of consent; yet in their hearts they
do not love the English of all other nations,
and therefore conclude, that the English
in their hearts do not love them.</p>


<p class="center">XX.</p>

<p>No gentleman, priest, or servant, male
or female, ever gives any notice by knocking
before they enter the bed-chamber,
or apartment of ladies or gentlemen.&mdash;The
post-man opens it, to bring your letters;
the capuchin, to ask alms; and the
gentleman to make his visit. There is no
privacy, but by securing your door by a
key or a bolt; and when any of the middling
class of people have got possession of
your apartment, particularly of a stranger,
it is very difficult to get them out.</p>


<p class="center">XXI.</p>

<p>There is not on earth, perhaps, so curious
and inquisitive a people as the lower
class of French: noise seems to be one of
their greatest delights. If a ragged boy
does but beat a drum or sound a trumpet,
he brings all who hear it about him, with
the utmost speed, and most impatient curiosity.&mdash;As
my monkey rode postillion,
in a red jacket laced with silver, I was obliged
to make him dismount, when I
passed thro' a town of any size: the people
gathered so rapidly about me at <i>Moret</i>,
three leagues from <i>Fontainbleau</i>, while I
stopped only to buy a loaf, that I verily believe
every man, woman, and child, except
the sick and aged, were paying their respects
to my little groom; all infinitely delighted;
for none offered the least degree
of rudeness.</p>


<p class="center">XXII.</p>

<p>The French never give coffee, tea, or any
refreshment, except upon particular occasions,
to their morning or evening visitors.</p>


<p class="center">XXIII.</p>

<p>When the weather is cold, the fire
small, and a large company, some young
Frenchman shuts the whole circle from receiving
any benefit from it, by placing
himself just before it, laying his sword
genteely over his left knee, and flattering
himself, while all the company wish him
at the devil, that the ladies are admiring
his legs: when he has gratified his vanity,
or is thoroughly warm, he sits down, or
goes, and another takes his place. I have
seen this abominable ill-breeding kept up
by a set of <i>accomplished</i> young fops for two
hours together, in exceeding cold weather.
This custom has been transplanted lately
into England.</p>


<p class="center">XXIV.</p>

<p>Jealousy is scarce known in France; by
the time the first child is born, an indifference
generally takes place: the husband
and wife have their separate acquaintance,
and pursue their separate <i>amusements</i>,
undisturbed by domestic squabbles: when
they meet in the evening, it is with perfect
good humour, and in general, perfect good
breeding.&mdash;When an English wife plays
truant, she soon becomes abandoned: it is
not so with the French; they preserve appearances
and proper decorum, because
they are seldom attached to any particular
man. While they are at their toilet, they
receive the visits of their male acquaintance,
and he must be a man of uncommon
discernment, who finds out whom it
is she prefers at that time.&mdash;In the southern
parts of France, the women are in
general very <i>free</i> and <i>easy</i> indeed.</p>


<p class="center">XXV.</p>

<p>It is seldom that virgins are seduced in
France; the married women are the objects
of the men of gallantry. The seduction
of a young girl is punished with
death; and when they fall, it is generally
into the arms of their confessor,&mdash;and that
is seldom disclosed. Auricular confession
is big with many mischiefs, as well as
much good. Where the penitent and the
confessor happen both to be young, he
makes her confess not only all her sins,
but sinful thoughts, and then, I fear he
knows more than his prudence can absolve
<i>decently</i>, and even when the confessor is old,
the penitent may not be out of danger.</p>


<p class="center">XXVI.</p>

<p>Never ask a Frenchman his age; no
question whatever can be more offensive to
him, nor will he ever give you a direct,
though he may a civil answer.&mdash;<i>Lewis</i>
the XVth was always asking every man
about him, his age. A King may take
that liberty, and even then, it always gives
pain.&mdash;<i>Lewis</i> the XIVth said to <i>Comte de
Grammont</i>, "<i>Je sais votre age, l'Eveque de
Senlis qui a 84 ans, m'a donne pour epoque,
que vous avez etudie ensemble dans la meme
classe</i>." <i>Cet Eveque, Sire</i>, (replied the
<i>Comte,) n'accuse pas juste, car ni lui, ni moi
n'avons jamais Etudie</i>.&mdash;Before I knew
how offensive this question was to a
Frenchman, I have had many equivocal
answers,&mdash;such as, <i>O! mon dieu</i>, as old
as the town, or, I thank God, I am in
good health, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="center">XXVII.</p>

<p>A modern French author says, that the
French language is not capable of the <i>jeux
de mots</i>. <i>Les jeux de mots</i>, are not, says he,
in the genius <i>de notre langue, qui est grave,
de serieuse</i>. Perhaps it maybe so; but the
language, and the men, are then so different,
that I thought quite otherwise,&mdash;though
the following beautiful specimen
of the seriousness of the language ought,
in some measure; to justify his remark:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Un seul est frapp&eacute;, &amp; tous sont delivr&eacute;s,</div>
<div class="i0">Dieu frappe sons fils innocent, pour l'amour</div>
<div class="i0">Des hommes coupables, &amp; pardonne aux hommes</div>
<div class="i0">Coupables, pour l'amour de son fils innocent.</div>
</div></div>


<p class="center">XXVIII.</p>

<p>All English women, as well as women of
other nations, prefer France to their own
country; because in France there is much
less restraint on their actions, than there is,
(should I not say, than there <i>was</i>?) in England.
All Englishmen, however, who have
young and beautiful wives, should, if they
are not indifferent about their conduct, avoid
a trip to <i>Paris</i>, &amp;c. tho' it be but for
"<i>a six weeks tour</i>." She must be good
and wise too, if six weeks does not corrupt
her mind and debauch her morals, and
that too by her own sex, which is infinitely
the most dangerous company. A French
woman is as great an adept at laughing an
English-woman into all contempt of fidelity
to her husband, as married English-women
are in general, in preparing them
during their first pregnancy, for the touch
of a man-midwife,&mdash;and both from the
same motive; <i>i.e.</i> to do, as they have done,
and bring all the sex upon a level.</p>


<p class="center">XXIX.</p>

<p>The French will not allow their language
to be so difficult to speak properly, as the
English language; and perhaps they are in
the right; for how often do we meet with
Englishmen who speak French perfectly?
how seldom do we hear a Frenchman speak
English without betraying his country by
his pronunciation? It is not so with the
Spaniards; I conversed with two Spaniards
who were never twenty miles from <i>Barcelona</i>,
that spoke English perfectly well.&mdash;How,
for instance, shall a Frenchman who
cannot pronounce the English, be able to
understand, (great as the difference is)
what I mean when I say <i>the sun is an hour
high</i>? May he not equally suppose that I
said <i>the sun is in our eye</i>?</p>


<p class="center">XXX.</p>

<p>When you make an agreement with an
<i>aubergiste</i> where you intend to lie, take
care to include beds, rooms, &amp;c. or he will
charge separately for these articles.</p>


<p class="center">XXXI.</p>

<p>After all, it must be confessed, that <i>Mons.
Dessein's a l'Hotel d'Angleterre</i> at <i>Calais</i>,
is not only the first inn strangers of fashion
generally go to, but that it is also the first
and best inn in France. <i>Dessein</i> is the decoy-duck,
and ought to have a salary from
the French government: he is always sure
of a good one from the English.</p>


<p class="center">XXXII.</p>

<p>In frontier or garrison towns, where they
have a right to examine your baggage, a
twenty-four <i>sols</i> piece, and assuring the officer
that you are a gentleman, and not a
merchant, will carry you through without
delay.</p>


<p class="center">XXXIII.</p>

<p>Those who travel post should, before
they set out, put up in parcels the money
for the number of horses they use for one
post, two posts, and a post <i>et demi</i>, adding
to each parcel, that which is intended to
be given to the driver, or drivers, who are
intitled by the King's ordinance to five
<i>sols</i> a post; and if they behave ill, they
should be given no more; when they are
civil, ten or twelve <i>sols</i> a post is sufficient.
If these packets are not prepared, and
properly marked, the traveller, especially
if he is not well acquainted with the money,
cannot count it out while the horses
are changing, from the number of beggars
which surround the carriage and who will
take no denial.</p>


<p class="center">XXXIV.</p>

<p>People of rank and condition, either going
to, or coming from the continent, by
writing to <span class="smcap">Peter Fector</span>, Esq; at <i>Dover</i>,
will find him a man of property and character,
on whom they may depend.</p>


<p class="center">LASTLY,</p>

<p>Valetudinarians, or men of a certain
age, who travel into the southern parts of
France, Spain, or Italy, should never omit
to wear either a callico or fine flannel waistcoat
under their shirts: strange as it may
seem to say so, this precaution is more
necessary in the south of France, than in
England. In May last it was so hot at <i>Lyons</i>,
on the side of the streets the sun shone
on, and so cold on the shady side, that
both were intolerable. The air is much
more <i>vif</i> and penetrating in hot climates,
than in cold. A dead dog, thrown into
the streets of Madrid at night, will not
have a bit of flesh upon his bones after it
has been exposed to that keen air twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
